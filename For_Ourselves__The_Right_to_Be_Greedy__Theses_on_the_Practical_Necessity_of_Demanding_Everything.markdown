## Introduction

**1.** Greed in its fullest sense is the *only possible* basis of communist
society.

**2.** The present forms of greed lose out, in the end, because they turn out
to be *not greedy enough*.

**3.** The repression of egoism can never totally succeed, except as the
destruction of human subjectivity, the extinction of the human species itself,
because egoism is an *essential moment* of human subjectivity. Its repression
simply means that it returns in a hidden, duplicitous form. If it cannot show
itself in the open market, it will find itself or create for itself a black
market. If it is not tolerated in transparent[^1] relations, the repressed
self will split in two; into a *represented self*, a personal organization of
appearances, a *persona*, and that which cringes and plots behind this
*character-armour*[^2]. The repression of egoism, contrary to the dictates of
*every one* of the *so-called* “Communists” (in *opposition* to Marx and
Engels), from Lenin right down to Mao, can *never* be the basis of communist
society.

Moreover, the repressive conception of “communism” misses precisely the whole
point. It misses out on the *validity* of the egoistic moment. This is true
*even* in the *inverted* form in which it emerges from an immanent critique of
altruistic ideology: if I die, the *world* dies *for me*. Without life, I
cannot love another. However, what it misses in “theory” — i.e., in its
ideological representations — it nonetheless preserves in practice, and
precisely with the help of that very ideology: its real basis is the egoism of
the state-capitalist bureaucracy. This ideology of self-sacrifice serves
admirably the task of extracting surplus-labour from the proletariat. The
actual negation of narrow egoism is a matter of transcendence
(“aufhebung”[^3]), of the transition from a narrow to a qualitatively expanded
form of egoism. The original self-expansion of egoism was identically the
demise of the primitive community. But its further self-expansion will resolve
itself into a community once again. It is only when greed itself at last (or
rather, once again) beckons in the direction of community that that direction
will be taken. Here the ancient Christian truth that no earthly force can
withstand human greed rejoins us on our side of the barricades.

**4.** It was the struggle over their growing wealth which rent asunder the
early tribal and village communities[^4]. The elaboration of the patriarchal
pattern, the growth of exchange-relations, of usury, debt-slavery, and war can
all be traced to this. It is only when the same motive which originally
occasioned this dissolution of community calls for its reconstitution that
community can be constituted again. And this motive is, simply, *the struggle
for a richer life*. For only that motive is irresistible: only that motive —
greed — can undo its own work. It is only when that subjective moment, through
the historical deepening of its own possibility, turns against its own present
objectification — in a word, *capital* (capitalist private property, privative
appropriation; that is, privatization, exclusion — “society” as an association
of strangers, of estrangement — in short, the totality of alienation) — that
the threshold of the great transformation is reached. And the struggle of this
new subjectivity against the previous objectification (global capitalist
society; in a word, *capital*), the process of the negation of that
objectification *is* the communist revolution.

**5.** We have no doubt that people are corruptible, but we know for ourselves
that there are things more tempting, more seductive, than money, capital, and
Power[^5] — so much so that no genuinely greedy human being could possibly
resist their allure — and it is upon *this* corruptibility of man that we
found our hopes for revolution. Revolution is nothing other than the
self-accelerating spread throughout society of this more profound corruption,
of this deeper seduction. Currently, greed is always pursued and associated
with isolation and privatism simply because everyone under the reign of
capital is condemned to pursue greed in this narrow way. Greed doesn't yet
know its own potentiality.

We say once again: the present forms of greed lose out in the end because they
turn out to be *not greedy enough*.

**6.** Narrow greed is a holdover from times of natural scarcity. Its desires
are represented to itself in the form of commodities, power, sex(-objects),
and even more abstractly, as money and as images. We are told in a thousand
ways that only these few things are worth having — by rulers who work to
insure that these are the only things available (to be bought). The survival
of the narrow greed in a world of potential plenty is propagated in the form
of ideology by those very people who control access to these things.
Ultimately, in our daily lives, we suffer the humiliation of being forced
accomplices in the maintenance of this “scarcity,” this poverty of choices.

**7.** Narrow greed will turn *against itself*. *No* more powerful weapon
against greed could possibly be found than greed itself. There could be no
more formidable tool for transforming narrow selfishness than this selfishness
itself. In its own process, through its own development, it must discover a
fuller form of greed, and a richer form of wealth. It must discover its own
narrowness.

A frontal assault on someone's narrow selfishness will run up against his
strongest defenses. Wouldn't it be easier to turn that strength around upon
itself? Wouldn't it be easier to induce that person to transform (him)/(her)
self[^6] through (his)/(her) own desires? This is the *method of seduction.* It
involves speaking from what is most radical in you to what is most radical in
the other person; that is, speaking from what you really *have in common:*root
subjectivity; radical *subjectivity*, the basis, at last historically
discovered, upon which to work out the construction of *authentic community*.
This is the method of *immanent critique*[^7]; of the evocation of
*self-critique*. It is the *practice of dialectic* itself. *Hic Rhodus! Hic
Salta!*

**8.** The perspective of *communist egoism* is the perspective of that
selfishness which desires nothing so much as other selves, of that egoism
which wants nothing so much as other egos; of that greed which is greedy to
love — love being the “total appropriation”[^8] of man by man.

**9.** Our reversal of perspective on egoism[^9], our *détournement*[^10] of
“greed,” and the scandalous effect which this produces and is intended to
produce in the prevailing consciousness, is no mere formal trick, and no
arbitrary play on words. Words, and precisely *because*of their meanings, are
a real part of history, of the “historical material,” and of the historical
process. To abandon them to their usurpers, to invent new words, or to use
other words because of the difficulty of winning back the true, historic
words, is to abandon the field to the enemy. It is a theoretical concession,
and a practical concession, which we cannot afford. To do so would only add to
the confusion, a confusion which, in part, forms the basis of the established
order[^11].

Our reversal of perspective, on the contrary, is clarifying within the very
terms of the confusion. It is already a revolutionary act at the level of the
subjective conditions of revolution: the reversed perspective — the *revolved*
perspective — is the perspective of revolution itself. Ideology is the
*sublime* hustle. The use-value of ideology is as a tool for exploitation —
the ideologue uses ideology to con you into letting him put his egoism above
yours, in the name of altruism, morality, and the “general interest.” Our
winning back in a positive connotation of a word like “greed” or “selfishness”
— the central, universal, and mutually agreed upon prejoratives of the two
extreme representations of modern capitalism, private capitalist and state
capitalist ideology, which try to confine the totality of possible opposition
within the universe bounded by their polar pseudo-opposition — is such an act
because it locates precisely the point of their essential unity, the exact
point of departure for a revolutionary movement which, by breaking away there,
simultaneously, identically, and singularly breaks with both.

No less is our expropriation of a word like “communism” such an act, for it is
already an “expropriation of the expropriators.”[^12] The “Free World” is not
free and the “Communist World” is not communist.

**10.** We use the words “communist society” to mean the direct *opposite* of
that which masquerades as such in the present world namely, bureaucratic
state-capitalism[^13]. That the classical private capitalist societies of the
“West” — themselves maturing toward a form of state-capitalism — collude with
“Eastern” powers in the propagation of this lie, is hardly an accident, and
should come as no surprise. It is, rather, one facet among myriads of an
“antagonistic cooperation”[^14] which reveals the hidden essential unity
binding together these *pseudo-opposites*.

The true communist society begins with the expropriation of the *whole* of
capitalist society by “the associated producers”[^15], which, if we are to
judge by the numerous[^16] historical attempts at this process so far, will
take the form of global organization of workplace, community, regional, etc.,
councils; the *workers' councils*, or, to use their original, Russian name,
expropriated (in fact, as in name) by the Bolshevik bureaucrats — the
*Soviets*.

**11.** We conceive the *realized* social individual, “communist man,” as
having for his property — that is, for the object of his appropriation — his
whole society, the totality of his social life. All of society is wealth for
him. His intercourse with his society — i.e., his living relations with the
rest of the social individuals and their objectification — is in its totality
*the appropriation of social life*. Productive activity becomes a form of
individual consumption just as consumption itself is a form of (self)
production.

The activity of simultaneous appropriation by each individual of all the rest,
or of the appropriation of society by all at once inter-appropriation
(realized inter-subjectivity, or co-property) — itself constitutes the
totality of social *production*. This appropriation by all at once of all is
none other than the resonance[^17] state of egoism:

> “*Communism* is the *positive* abolition of *private property*, of *human
> self-alienation*, and [is] *thus the real appropriation* of *human* nature
> through and for *man.*”
>
> — Karl Marx, ‘Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts’ in T.B. Bottomore,
> *Karl Marx, Early Writings*, McGraw-Hill, (New York, 1963), p. 155.

In communist society, according to its concept, the “form”, of
intercourse[^18] becomes the total appropriation of man by man. Social
individuals can appropriate one another *subjectively* (i.e., *as subjects*),
and *all-sidedly*, through all the forms of human intercourse — by talking
together, producing together, making love together, etc., etc., and all the
fruits of their appropriation, i.e., *themselves* in their developed richness,
become thus the property of themselves, and of all society, of all the other
social individuals.

The fruits of your appropriation, of your consumption of physical and
emotional riches, is something from which I am *excluded* at the level of
immediacy, of immediate consumption: you eat the pear, therefore I cannot eat
just that bite of just that pear; you share your love with this person, and I
am perhaps excluded from sharing myself at this moment with you. But this is
not at all a problem for me, for I am busy elsewhere, with the same project
and praxis of self-enrichment on my own and together with others. But later,
mediately, when I come back to you, your appropriation, and the
self-enrichment you derive from it, comes back to me, becomes my consumption,
*my* appropriation, *in my appropriation of you*, and is the richer for it.
Today, we have to be jealous of each others' pleasures not because our
pleasures are so many and so great, but because they are so meager and so few.
Here, on the other side of poverty, on the other side of scarcity, my jealousy
would only deprive myself, my exclusion of your pleasure would only exclude my
own, and I am free at last to take pleasure in your pleasure. Whereas, within
the realm of poverty, your strength is a threat to me, your development is at
the expense of mine, and in general your addition is my subtraction; on the
contrary, in the society of realized wealth, your strength is my strength, the
inner wealth of your being is my wealth, my property, and every one of your
human powers is a *multiplication of* my own. Thus, the contradiction between
my consumption and yours, between my appropriation, my property, and yours;
the conflict between my well-being and yours becomes its opposite: synthesis;
identity; inter-reinforcement; interamplification; resonance.

**12.** The positive conception of egoism, the perspective of communist
egoism, is the very heart and unity of our theoretical and practical
coherence. This perspective is the essence of what separates us from both the
left and the right. We cannot allow its fundamental importance to be obscured,
or ourselves to be mistaken for either the right or the left. We cannot allow
any Leninist organization to get away with claiming that it is only ‘a *little
bit pregnant*’ with state capitalism.

**16.** The resonance of egoisms has to be looked at from the point of view of
wealth (greed): developed individuals make a richer community, and a richer
community makes for richer individualities. Beyond a certain stage of the
development of productive forces, ‘collectivism = the suppression of
individuality’ is a forfeiture of wealth for the community, just as
‘individualism = the suppression of community’ is a forfeiture of wealth for
the individualist.

**17.** The impoverished man typical of capitalist society, the so-called
“greedy” man, is the man who is only excited by money, who is only interested
in fragments of other people — in buying their skills, their services, their
products, and the rest is “none of his business.” He lives in a world of
prostitutes, that is, a world of *proletarians*. He is the master of the
*partial* appropriation of man by man, that is, of *exploitation*.[^20] The
rich man, the greedy man of communist society, is the man who has discovered
how to appropriate the richest “thing” around, the most interesting and
valuable object, *the subject*, beginning with the appropriation of himself
*as such*; the man who has socially mastered the possibility together with the
necessary *conditions* of this *total* appropriation of man by man, the
coherence of whose social life is *the self-need of man*. This is the secret
of what we mean when we say: the negation of capital is the realization of
real wealth, subjectively and objectively.

The communist egoist, the genuinely greedy person, wants other subjects. The
narrow egoist, the exploiter, only wants *something from* them.

**18.** A society rich in selves is the only really rich society. Richness in
subjects, in subjectivity, in practically and creatively *potent* human
beings, is finally the only real wealth *for the subject*.

**19.** Ultimately, wealth is nothing but *society itself*.

**20.** The logic of exchange-value, of *commodity* exchange-relations, is the
very logic of narrow egoism itself.

In the exchange of a commodity which I own, for money owned by somebody else,
I have parted with, *alienated*, the use value of the commodity. It is lost to
me, in order that I may realize its exchange-value, its money form, its
general use-value, that is, its expression in the form of general social
usefulness or abstract labour-time, which I can then reconvert into *any*
particular use-value to the extent that its production has, by my stage of
capitalist development, assumed the form of commodity-production. Its general
usefulness — its usefulness as money, as exchange-value — is here in direct
contradiction to its particular usefulness, its specific use-value.

The logic of exchange-relations in communist society, according to the inner
coherence of its concept, is quite the contrary however. The use-values in
whose production I participate, and in whose consumption you and I both
participate, are not lost to me except if I consume them immediately, i.e.,
your consumption of them is not a loss for me. They are *social* use values,
and society is my larger self, my *necessary* self, absolutely necessary to my
production and reproduction. (Even if I should take up the life of an isolated
hermit, and somehow survive at it, my changed self-activity would shortly
render me a *different person*). Their use-value, consumed directly by others
returns to me in the form of the maintained or improved creative capacity of
those others in social production; in the form of the reposited or increased
production of the class of human beings upon whom my reproduction depends —
the single class — or rather, the single global *non-class* of associated
producers, who produce the *totality* of the wealth I consume; prerequisites
to my *production of my self*. Thus, no social use-value is alienated from me.
Rather, all of it stays within my (expanded) self, accumulates there, and goes
to enhance the total quality of my life.

Therefore, also, within the global production-planning process of the
councils, I have a legitimate beef whenever asked to participate in some
production which does not satisfy this logic. Any production which does not
satisfy this logic is truly socially destructive, antisocial, and an
anti-use-value (anti-wealth). It is therefore, at very best, a waste of my
time, that is, of my *life*. Anything that is not worthy to be preserved will
have to be destroyed.

**22.** In the last analysis, all you have to give is yourself. Your self is
your only gift. If you don't possess yourself — i.e., if you let yourself be
forced to *sell yourself* — you have nothing to bestow upon another
individual, another self. In the *realized* society called communist society,
exchange must become visibly and fully what it always was essentially, self
exchange.

## II. Individualism and Collectivism

“To be avoided above all is establishing ‘society’ once again as an
abstraction over against the individual. The individual is the *social*
being.”[^21] The expression of his life — even if it does not appear
immediately in the form of communal expression carried out together with
others — is therefore a manifestation and affirmation of *social* life. The
individual and generic life of man are not *distinct*, however much — and
necessarily so — the mode of existence of individual life is either a more
*particular* or a more general mode of generic or generic life a more
particular or *universal* mode of individual life.

**27.** Is it necessary once again to point out the self-absurdity of the
one-sided abstractions “the individual” and “society,” and of the ideologies
founded on this one-sidedness — “individualism” (or “egoism”) and so-called
“socialism” (or “collectivism”)?

We can be individuals *only socially*. We can be social *only individually.*
Individuals constitute society. Society constitutes individuals.

**28.** Dig deeply enough into the individual and you will find society. Dig
deeply enough into society and you will find the individual. Dig deeply enough
into either and you will come out the “other” side. The concept named “the
individual,” fully grasped, is the same as the concept named “society.” The
concept named “society,” fully grasped, is also “the individual.” One is
impossible, *does not exist*, without the other. At the heart of society is
its “opposite,” the individual. At the center of the individual is his
“*antithesis*”, society. We must speak of the *social individual*. Both of the
abstract universals, “society” and “the individual” find their *concrete*
universal in the *social individual*.

**29.** Society, without the individual, is empty, is without its existence,
just as the individual, without society, is without its existence — and even
*outside* human society, is not a *human* individual (even if it should chance
to survive as a *biological* individual. However, even as such, it is the
issue of a human social — in this case, sexual — relationship). Unless both
these moments can be affirmed *simultaneously*, *univocally*; grasped as a
single, unitary concept — in fact as a *conceptual singularity* — their
contradiction having been transcended (to begin with, in thought), then
neither “the individual” nor “society” has been understood.

**30.** Self-production can only be social; society *is* self-production, that
is, society is the only possible means-of-production of selves. You cannot
ever talk about the “self” without identically implicating or talking about
“society.” The “self” exists only in association with other selves, i.e. in
and as an association of selves, a society. It is no accident that the Latin
root of 'consciousness' — *conscienta* — means literally “together-knowledge”;
“to know together.”[^24] Subjectivity is essentially *inter*subjective, that
is, *essentially social*.

**31.** Your “individuality” is already a “social structure,” and has been so
*from its very inception* (including, from its very *conception*).

**32.** Individuals are produced only by society. Society is produced only by
individuals.

**33.** Society can be realized only egoistically, just as the ego can be
arrived at, can be realized, and is possible at all *only socially*.

**34.** The self is pre-eminently and essentially social; society is
pre-eminently and essentially selfish.

**35.** If the philosophers of one-sided individualism, of narrow egoism —
that is, of the axiology of the self — want to understand Marx's socialism,
they should reflect on his statement to the effect that the *other is a
necessary part of your self*.[^25]

**36.** The principle “I want nothing other than myself” — the principle of
self-desire, self-attachment (self-cathexis, or self-centration) — becomes the
principle of daily life in communist society once it is socially actualized
that the other is a necessary part of my self.[^26] Society becomes an object
of cathexis without this any longer necessitating projection-identification —
i.e., the alienation of cathexis from the self — once the social nature of the
self, and the “self nature” of society has become a palpable and transparent
truth of experience.

**37.** State-capital, in sublating[^27] private capital, negates or
represses private capital. The ideology of anti-individualism — that is, of
collectivism or one-sided socialism — so essential to Maoism in particular and
to revolutionary ideology[^28] in general is congruent precisely with the
project of the repression of private capitalism and private accumulation,
together with the characterological tendencies corresponding to these, on the
part of bureaucratic capitalism (state-capitalism). This policy of repression,
typified by the Maoist slogan “smash self”[^29], also has the effect of
inhibiting the emergence of *communist* egoism within the home proletariat; a
form of egoism which the bureaucracy confounds, consciously or unconsciously,
with bourgeois egoism.

**38.** Even privatism itself is a *social expression* (see Theses 23); an
expression of social life in a definite historical form of society. That is,
privatism is itself an expression of the social *individual* produced by
contemporary society. People who do not think dialectically end up making
enormous errors here, practically as well as theoretically, because they can
not grasp contemporary as itself a *social truth*, an (admittedly
self-reproducing) *subjectification* (i.e., internalization), of capitalist
society, which is precisely an *antisocial society*. So much so that ‘the
socialization of society’ is, where capitalist society is concerned, but
another name for the project of social revolution itself. The ideologies of
*anti-socialism* are based on the *misery of association* (collective boredom,
inauthentic association, etc.)[^30] under contemporary conditions, that is, on
the misery of association-as-*alienation* and as-estrangement. They are
expressions of the *poverty of social life* — its virtual nonexistence *as
such* — in the world of strangers, the *bellum omnium contra omnes*, which is
capitalist society.

**39.** The leftist, trapped in the permanent false choice between following
his own immediate desires and sacrificing for his ideals, despises the
“selfish” person who unhesitatingly chooses immediate, private satisfaction.
The genuine communist also despises this latter type, but for the opposite
reason: being restricted to immediate private satisfaction is not satisfying
enough. To the communist, furthermore, for such “selfish” people to remain
satisfied with their privatized, alienated lives is a direct barrier to the
realization of the communist's own expanded self-interest. Somewhere in every
rank and file leftist lurks a confused intuition that this is the real reason
for his contempt: but this intuition is continually stifled by the leftist's
own insistence on the “necessity” of sacrifice.

**40.** The lonely individualism of Ayn Rand[^31], et. al., is only alienation
accepted and alienation perfected. Communist individualism or individualist
communism is the name for the solution to the riddle of pre-history, which,
while it has momentarily, at times and places in this century, existed, as yet
knows not its own name.

**41.** Any “collectivism” on our part is an *individualist* collectivism. Any
“individualism” on our part is a *collectivist* individualism.

Fine. As it stands, this theorem is wholly acceptable. This is a classic
statement of the egoistic postulate by the classic exponent of individualist
anarchism and narrow egoism, and an early antagonist of Marx, Max Stirner. His
latter-day followers, conscious and unconscious, include the “Objectivists,”
the “classical liberals”, and the so-called “libertarian right” in general.
The problem is that, in the further elaboration of his own book, Stirner's own
understanding of his own statement proved to be unequal to it. Stirner proved
to be insensitive to what the concept of “self” — in order to be adequate to
reality — must entail; what must be its content, if it is expanded (i.e.,
developed) beyond the level of its self-contradiction — namely all of the
other selves which intermutually “constitute” or produce it; in short,
society. This error in general must be attributed to undeveloped concrete
self-knowledge; Stirner did not know himself, his own true identity. He did
not know himself as society, or society as his real self.

**43.** If the validity of the egoistic moment has not been understood, then
nothing has been understood. For each social individual, when his life is at
stake, everything is at stake. If I allow myself to be sacrificed, then I have
allowed the whole world — all possible values — to be sacrificed as far as I
am concerned. If I am lost, then all the world is lost to me. Each time a
person dies, a world dies.

**44.** The community of egoists is the only possible community not founded on
the repression of individual development and thus ultimately of collective
development as well.

**45.** “Communist egoism” names the synthesis of individualism and
collectivism, just as *communist society* names the actual, material, sensuous
solution to the historical contradiction of the “particular” and the “general”
interest, a contradiction engendered especially in the cleavage of society
against itself into classes. This “solution” cannot be of the form of a mere
idea or abstraction, but only of a concrete form of society.

**46.** The global and exclusive power of workers' councils, of the
anti-state[^32], of the associated producers[^33], or “generalized
self-management”[^34] that is, *concerted egoism*, is the productive force and
the social relation of production which can supersede all the results of the
uncoordinated egoistic activity of men. These are, in their totality,
alienation; the unconscious development of the economy, and the unconscious
production by the proletariat of the economic “laws” of capitalism, with all
their disastrous consequences for the proletariat. The theory of communist
egoism is complete only as a theory of revolutionary organization and as a
theory of revolutionary practice in general; as a theory of the new social
relations and as a theory of the practice of the councils. That is, it is
adequate only as a theory of communist society and as a theory of the
transition from (state) capitalist to communist society. Obviously then, these
theses have still a long way to go toward the concrete.

**47.** The essence of communism is egoism; the essence of egoism is
communism. This is the world-changing secret which the world at large still
keeps from itself. The unraveling of this secret as the emergence of radical
subjectivity is nothing other than the process of the formation of communist
society itself. It already contains the objective process.

**49.** Thus, in a sense, all history has (in the long run and if only
implicitly) been a process of individualization. This individualization
reaches its highest point of *advertisement* in the epoch of corporate
capitalism. But private property's “individualism” is naught but its most
cherished illusion. The predominant characteristic of private property is a
materialized reification where the egoism of its subjects (capitalists and
workers alike) is suppressed and subordinated to the pseudo-subjectivity of
the “economy for itself.”[^35] The truth of the capitalist society and its
private property is not individual property, but dispossession — viz., the
proletariat. The truth of private property is nothing other than the
production, reproduction, and growth of a dispossessed and propertyless class,
i.e., the class of wage-labour. Private property is thus the very negation of
individualism and of individual property. For the overwhelming majority of its
subjects, i.e. the proletariat, private property is by no means individual
property, but rather it is loss (i.e. sale — alienation) of self,
being-for-another. Even the capitalists are at best mere agents of capital —
managers of their own (and of the general) dispossession. The mythical
“individualism” of capitalist society can only be realized in its own negation
and in the negation of the society from which it sprang. Thus the Paris
Commune of 1871, the first realized “Dictatorship of the
Proletariat,”[^36][^37] attempted to abolish private property in order “to
make individual property a truth.”[^38]

The revolution of generalized self-management is the movement from narrow to
full egoism, egoism's own self-enrichment. It is egoism's ascent from the
realm of necessity to the realm of freedom.

## III. The Dialectic of Egoism

**50.** The *concept* of communist society can be arrived at, by one pathway,
through the analysis and development of the *self*-contradiction of egoism, of
the self-contradictory structure of the egoistic project. Communist society
itself, and the self-transcendance of the narrow egoism of privatized man, can
only be the outcome of the immanent and historical *dialectic of egoism*
itself.

**51.** The egoistic project, in order to become adequate to itself, must
include more than one ego.

**52.** Communist egoism, likewise communist society, is only the final[^39]
conclusion of the immanent critique[^40], the *self*-critique — of bourgeois
egoism, of privatized life.

**53.**

>
> — Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, *The German Ideology*, op. cit., p. 272.

**54.** The suppression of private egoism follows the same course as private
egoism[^42]. The path out of narrow egoism is the straight and narrow path of
this egoism itself.[^43] (But, as Einstein argued with respect to *physical*
time-space, what is straight and narrow from the narrow viewpoint of the
immanent observer may be anything but straight to a larger view — highly
curvaceous, in fact; even curved back on itself). The abstract negation of
egoism — repression — will not suffice, but only its determinate negation, and
its immanent negation — that is, auto-negation.

**55.** The development of egoism — the historical phenomenology of
subjectivity — is a dialectic also in this sense: the way out of narrow egoism
passes through narrow egoism itself. *And all attempts to block this way tend
only to inhibit the development and arrest it at this narrow stage*.

**56.** Private egoism is egoism in conflict with its own essence. (But this
*becomes true* visibly, and therefore fully, once, and only once, the
conditions necessitating *narrow appropriation* — often lumped sloppily under
the confusionist category “scarcity” — are gone and the conditions for a
fuller, wider appropriation have matured. Specifically, this means the
conditions for the appropriation of other people as *subjects* (mutuality) as
opposed to merely as *objects*(exploitation). Thus, for example, the present
“recession,” the growth of poverty and desperation which it entails, has been
at first a major setback in this regard, and has drastically curtailed the
daily experiential base which for a while — at the peak of the “prosperity” of
the sixties — made this critique *feel true*.).

**57.** What we tend not to be immediately aware of is that the prevailing
narrow and impoverishing form of egoism, of self-gratification, is one deeply
mixed with its opposite; with the *renunciation* of self-gratification; that
the “greed” we normally experience is a greed radically admixed with its own
*negation*, with the embittered *renunciation* of greed, basing itself as it
must on the narrow conditions of self-enjoyment presently available and
especially formerly available to it, under conditions of extreme deprivation
and toil. Specifically, the form of self-enjoyment which is excluded, the
secret self-denial hiding at the heart of privatized egoism, is the denial of
all the *social pleasures*, the *communal pleasures* of spontaneous
gregariousness, the warmth of human solidarity, the exuberance of *authentic*
festivity — the *pleasures of association* and *social satisfaction* in
general. The vestiges of these are confined within the ever-narrowing circle
of the private family, itself the nuclear remnant, adapted by capital, of the
bygone primitive-communist kinship societies and their “extended families”,
which publicizes its final self-critique in the burgeoning rates of divorce,
divorce being recognized as and officially titled “estrangement.” This
especially in the “advanced” capitalist countries — that is, the countries
which have reached the advanced stages of *social alienation*.

The lag in appropriation of the newer conditions of “non-scarcity,” of
potential and (to some extent already) actual abundance, is the context in
which the present historical stage of the 'dialectic of egoism' must be
understood. The positive moment of the early “hip” movement (of which moment
today's professional street vermin and gutter hippies are in no sense the
heirs) — the whole libidinal emergence which began in the sixties, and now, in
the recession of the seventies, is eclipsed again is comprehensible in part as
a beginning of the appropriation of those new conditions.[^44]

**58.** The *root illusion* of all pious and ascetic ideologies is that, since
exploitation is the partial appropriation of man by man, the way to rid the
world of this “sin” is in instituting the *non-appropriation* of man by man,
rather than the *total appropriation*: that the way to the negation
(“quieting”) of desire is its *repression* rather than its *fulfillment*:
touch me not and I will touch not thee. The logic of privation. The problem of
the misery of narrow egoism admits of only two solutions: either (1) its
exaggeration to the point where it overspills its own limits; its expansion
until it becomes one with the totality, rediscovering precisely *within
itself* its supposed opposite and that which it formerly excluded, or (2) its
repression, and with that evidentially, the unending reign of the present
form, which is all that its historical repression has so far succeeded in
producing.

**59.** Communism is not the self-repression of egoism. It is only when narrow
egoism *wants* to transcend itself for its *own deepest reasons*: when it
finds internal reasons, egoistic reasons; when it sees itself becoming its own
ruin, defeating to itself, self-defeating, and — therefore, self-contradictory
— that it brings itself to *its own* end, and communism begins. Private egoism
historically is its own undoing. Its exercise brings about its own
socialization — social egoism. Communism is the negation of egoism only by
virtue of being a higher form of egoism — egoism's own higher form. Narrow
egoism, the *ideology* of self-gratification and self-realization, and the
practice of *exclusive* self-gratification and self-realization becomes, at a
certain stage in its development, a fetter upon self-realization and a fetter
upon selfgratification. It becomes the main limit and obstacle to its own
goals. It becomes a barrier to itself. This is the self-negativity which
awakens in it the desire for its own transcendance: for self-transcendance, a
supersession in accord with itself, with its own essence, and on its own
terms, basing itself on the possibility of the community of gratification as
the unlimited amplification of gratification. This is the immanent
self-critique of narrow egoism; the death sentence which it pronounces upon
itself. Thus the determinate negation of narrow egoism can only be through its
own organic development, its own further development. That is, it can only be
*self*-negation. “Happiness” at the expense of others; the exclusion of the
others' happiness from your own henceforth appears as a miserable basis; as
the opposite of happiness, as misery, and private property as a *wealth* of
poverty, compared to the new basis which has grown up secretly with modern
society itself.

Communism is the comprehension of exclusive egoism as *historically
self-contradictory* and thus finite: *doomed to perish* — as not eternal
“human nature” but, on the contrary, self-canceling; transitory;
*transitional*; as the decidedly unnatural (antisocial) condition of man prior
to the historical self-completion of the human species. Communism is the
comprehension of bourgeois egoism as already containing and implying its own
*historical negation*, as containing its own negation in embryo — containing
the seeds of its own destruction — by virtue of its being *false to itself*.
Society, “socialism” — and *social production* — was its repressed essence all
along.

**60.** All along the line, consciously or not, “me first” has always been the
necessary pattern of everyone's practice. Everyone at every moment of their
lives consciously or not acts in his own self-interest at some level. Anything
else would be inconceivable, impossible.[^45] Unable to pursue his desires
directly, a masochist uses the mediation of pain. The masochists of morality,
ideology and causes seek pleasure by means of the pain of subordinating
themselves through these projections. The moral idealist attempts to get what
he wants through the mediation of his projected ideal, because he doesn't know
how to get what he wants directly. He doesn't know the *practical* means
within himself as the subject and center of that practice, so he posits his
center outside of himself as a rigidified generalization which is to “decide
for him.” In so doing he makes the mistake of thinking that consistency with
his ideal is always consistency with his *self*-interest.

**61.** “Communist egoism” names the negation of the negation of primitive
egoism (narrow egoism). But the aspect of the process as an *immanent* or
*self*-critique, and never an *external* or *mechanical* negation (e.g. the
“smash self”[^46] ideology of Maoism) must above all be emphasized, against
all coercive and bureaucratic methods. Social(ized) egoism, communist egoism,
is the negation of the negation of capitalist egoism, but it is the
*self*-negation of the *self*-negation of that egoism. This second negation is
*essential* to narrow egoism itself, no less than the first negation, which
produces its antithesis — moralism, anti-egoism; altruism. This second
negation is *necessary* to narrow egoism, to the preservation of its own
premises, once it advances to a certain threshold in its self-development. The
proper method to catalyze — to stimulate and accelerate — this process is
another, i.e., from the ‘outside’, is the evocative method; the *method of
seduction*. The *method of rebuke*, though useful at certain crucial turns
here too, is, especially in the form of the *method of chastisement*, more
adequate to the first, not the second, negation of narrow egoism. The method
of chastisement is that of forcibly drawing out moral projections from the
psyche, of creating “handles” in the victim's head for easy manipulation
(“handling”) by authorities and ideologues of all sorts; of instilling
submissiveness, of inducing the split in the victim between the sense of
*duty* and the sense of *inclination*; of forming the guilt-loop of alienated
self-control. The second negation means, on the contrary, the *negation* of
altruism, the overcoming of all these separations; the collapse of the
projections back into the psyche; their re-owning in the coalescence of the
self: the *centration*, instead of the alienation, of self-control. This is
the very *formation* of the “self” capable of “self” management.

**62.** Don't get us wrong. Make no mistake. This theory is no *apologia* for
narrow egoism. We have no interest in that negation of altruism which is
simply a return to narrow egoism; a *regression*. Communist egoism, and not
altruism, is the *true opposite* of narrow egoism. Communist egoism, and not
narrow egoism, is the *true opposite* of altruism. Although altruism and
narrow egoism are commonly taken as true opposites, they have this in common:
an immanent critique of either must arrive at communist egoism. That is,
communist egoism is the *synthesis* of altruism and narrow egoism. Communist
egoism is simultaneously, identically *both* of them and *neither*; it is that
*unitary rejection* of both which is also their *unitary affirmation*.[^47]

**65.** Communist society is conceivable only on the foundation of the
*resonance of egoisms*. Thus its basis is the cohesion of egoisms, whereas
heretofore egoism has appeared as the force of separation and privitization
*par excellence*.

**66.** The essence of the resonance of egoisms is this: the other person is a
part of *your wealth*.[^48]

**67.** The resonance of egoisms is the unity, the synthesis, the singularity,
of the “particular” and the “general” interest: communist society.

**68.** The cohesion of communist society, once the threshold of its
conditions-proper has been reached, is conceivable on this basis: that the
community, society, *association itself* is the greatest personal value that
the social individuals each possess. That is, their *social relationships* are
this greatest value and this greatest wealth. The *social relation* itself
becomes the unitary, unified, and universal means to the attainment of every
end; to the gratification of every need, and thus also an end in itself.
Society holds together to the extent that the social individuals find a
greater value in its reproduction than in any act that would destroy it.

**71.** We anticipate a profound reversal of perspective at the threshold of
communal society, in which any possible strictly privatized value will pale
into insignificance, and be experienced as narrow and impoverished, in
comparison to the individual, personal, “private” value to each social
individual of his *social existence*. And this attitude would be then, under
those conditions, no mere idealistic posture or pious wish, no mere moral
abstraction, no representation over and above the real conditions — which is
all it can ever be today — but, on the contrary, would arise from the most
immediate, palpable, and concrete facts of life. Increasingly up to the
present, since the breakup of early communal forms, all wealth has been
private, that is, only private property has been recognized as wealth. In the
future, if there is a future, the narrow and the privatized will be revealed
as the essence of poverty, and wealth will be realized as *social wealth*, as
wealth in human beings; in their relations and their capacities, in their
faculties and their objectifications.[^49] That is, the greatest wealth, and
the necessary context of all wealth, is *society itself.*

**72.** The central problem of communist social relations is the following:
what is to be the basis of human relationships, of the interpersonal cohesion,
beyond kinship and exchange value, that is, beyond the *blood-relations* which
formed the incredible binding-force, and great weakness, of primitive
communist societies, and the *exchange-value relations* into which these
increasingly dissolved in the formation of class societies?

The solution can only be of the form of real affinity, practically,
*sensuously* discovered and verified, practically superseded and dissolved;
free association; the resonance of passions. But *within* this statement of
the solution, everything still remains to be said.

**73.** Let's get one thing straight right now. All this talk of “historical
necessity” and “inevitability” only succeeds in making of this mystic
“necessity” a pseudo-subject, and of decoying attention from the *real*
subjects, *ourselves*. Communist society is “historically determined” and
“objectively determined” to be produced only to the extent that we are
*subjectively* “bound and determined” to produce it. And this does not deny at
all that such a subjectivity has its *necessary objective conditions* that can
only develop historically.

## VI. Radical Subjectivity

**74.** What is this “radical subjectivity”?[^50] From now on, the
revolutionary subject is the *conscious* — and positively self-conscious —
egoist, as opposed to the unconscious or negatively self-conscious (guilty)
egoists among whom the revolutionary walks unrecognized but recognizing them.
He can sustain this positive attitude toward his expanded egoism, and its
first signs in others, by virtue of his comprehension of its positive social
outcome in a society, separated from this one by the socio-psychotherapeutic
process of revolution, in which the egoism of each is the first condition for
the fulfillment of the egoism of all.

**75.** Contrary to the ideological banality, it is only the most greedy
people who can never be “bought off.”[^51]

**76.** What we have called “communist egoism” is essentially the same as what
Vaneigem and his Situationists have named “radical subjectivity.” In all their
writings, it is there in “spirit,” if not ever fully in “letter.” In their
failure to develop this concept in all its ramifications, and to cohere their
whole practice with it, and in the remnants of moralism and secular
Christianism[^52] which therein still remained, we locate the very root of
their failure.

**77.** Radical subjectivity, that is, communist egoism or the (realized)
“social individual”[^53] is the *concrete universal* which is emergent in our
time. It is the particular which is (potentially) *everywhere*. Radical
subjectivity is our very root, the root of what we all have in common, the
real basis of community. Root subjectivity — the “primitive” human root —
could only be divulged as such at the far end of prehistory, as the outcome of
the process of that prehistory itself, and as the secret basis of its
supersession.

Within this monstrous decrepitude of contemporary “society”, the nihilist, its
commonplace product, knows only the first half of this statement. I am
nothing. Therefore, anything else can only be less than nothing to me. In the
upside-down world of alienation, it is the totality of things, of commodities,
of money, of capital, that is everything, and we, the workers who make it, are
shit. The nihilist is like a syllogism suspended at the minor premise, an
acrobat whose somersault is broken in mid-flight. For him, the logic of this
empirical truth, this truth of experience, of daily life, does not immediately
tumble over into its opposite, its necessary conclusion: I am nothing, *but I
must be everything!* — the conclusion that would make a revolutionary of him.
*We* produce commodities, money, capital. *We* produce everything that makes
up *social* wealth. We must become explicitly what we already are implicitly:
everything! This becoming-visible, this becoming-true of the social truth
expresses the total process of the communist revolution.

## VII. Pleasure

**79.** Bourgeois political economy, the science of the exchange-value, was
always only *the false consciousness of the economy*, and the science of
alienation.[^54] This is the first and final message of its Marxian critique.
With the dying-out of exchange-value, the science of use-value (thus all the
concrete sciences, now unified through their unified *subjective use*) will
become the only useful science. And the science of use-value is the *science
of pleasure*.

**81.** The major shortcoming of contemporary individuals is their *incapacity
for pleasure*. Our daily lives are impoverished in part because we are open to
the world, and therefore to pleasure (as well as to pain) only in such narrow
and limited ways. These are the defenses, the character-armour, congruent with
a world overloaded with pain, a world of suffering, which was and is the world
of poverty with its struggle for existence, its “war of all against all,”
where to be open is to be weak, and to be weak is to be made a victim. The
self-contradiction of bourgeois egoism sharpens and becomes conscious only in
the environment of that incipient world of plenty and world of pleasure which
bourgeois society, during the prosperity phase of its economic cycle, itself
foreshadows; that is, only when the walls which *lock* out pain begin to be
perceived in daily experience as walls which *lock* out pleasure. The struggle
against the social organization for pain and for the social organization for
pleasure is the revolutionary struggle.

The problem, formulated another way, is the present narrow character of “the
appropriation of nature and human nature by man.”[^57]

**82.** In the revolutionary process, the struggle is the struggle of
pleasure; the pleasure is the pleasure of struggle.

**83.** Today, people oppress each other by the smallness of their desire;
their poverty of social needs; their lack of a fuller egoism, a fuller greed.
We are asking people to ask for more, so that we can ask for more, and get
more from them — get what we can only get by being allowed *to give more*.

We do not ask you for much: we ask from you only your own egoism, and we do so
not out of altruism, but *for our own egoistic reasons*. From the depths of
our own, we ask you for the depths of yours. But in asking you for that, we
ask you to give everything you've got; to give your all.

**84.** “Positive human self-consciousness”[^58] can only be *guiltless
egoism*, which can only mean *communist egoism*, the egoism which does not
exclude the pleasure of other egos, but on the contrary, appropriates this as
its own pleasure, includes it precisely *for its own selfish reasons*.

**85.** The negatively self-conscious egoist is the guilty egoist, the egoist
who strives after his own narrow desires guiltily, and thus works against
himself; resists himself — opposes a part of his own energy to his own
project. It is the energy presently tied-up in guilt, in self-policing, in
self-repression — character-armor — which, once freed can build the new world.

People seeking, in good conscience and without guilt, more pleasure for their
own everyday lives, contain the whole of the revolution.

**86.** Self-sacrifice is always Christian. Always.

**87.** The ‘expansion of egoism’ refers not only to the expansion (of
self-identity) over many selves at any one time, but also to its expansion
over time “at” any one self. The sacrifice of a future, greater pleasure to a
more immediate but lesser one is precisely that: *sacrifice*; not the other
way around. The responsible individual must decide *for himself* what is to
his greatest advantage: this theory is no *morality* that can *decide for
him*. The theory and practice of expanded egoism can have no consort with any
*ideology* of *hedonism*, any more than with any brand of *puritanism*. This
theory and practice is inseparable from the *expanded consciousness of
pleasure* whose possibility has developed in the historical labour process, in
the expansion of human capacities, self-powers, and needs. And it is
inseparable no less from that *pleasure of consciousness* which it implies and
contains and which simultaneously contains it. Self-discipline, as directly
*opposed* to authoritarian discipline, externally imposed and internalized as
such — the coherent use of my life for myself, according to my own immanent
standards and to ends of my own, is in itself already a pleasure for me.
Self-mastery, the conscious and *effective* wielding of myself for myself in
the world, is indeed an *esthetic* self-pleasure. It is the *art* of
life.[^59]

When my self is the work of my own art, and my own work of art, then I take
pleasure in myself. Then I know myself as wealth — *for* myself as well as
*for* others. I know myself as rich, as rich in myself, as a wealthy man
through my self-possession. And yet this subjective wealth, this richness in
self which I possess is also *society*. This is proven by the fact that
outside society, or without it, all my wealth would wither into dust. The
*identity* of myself and my society is proven by the fact that the
non-existence of society implies the non-existence of myself. But this is a
dialectical, mediated identity, not a formal, abstract, immediate one; an
identity that preserves within itself the moment of differentiation.

## VIII. Sexuality

**88.**

>
> — Karl Marx, *Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts*, in T.B. Bottomore,
> loc. cit., p. 154.

**89.** Orgastically potent[^61] sexual experience is the very *archetype* of
the resonance of egoisms: the immediate unity of pleasure-getting and
pleasure-giving.

**90.** I don't just want a fuller sex life; I want my whole life to be a
“sex-life”!

**91.** The sociality of man reveals itself nowhere more strongly than in
sexual sociability and sexual solidarity. The sexual need, more profoundly and
more immediately than any other, reveals the fallacy of narrow egoism — the
need to touch another person, another's body; to be physically close, to
caress and be caressed. Perhaps it is out of the desire, congruent with narrow
egoism, to deny the inter-subjectivity of this most profoundly
inter-subjective of needs, that so many perversions begin; in order to
objectify[^62] the subject who is the aim of this need.

But here also is a threshold, and an “attractor”[^63] where the expansion of
egoism can stop, can get hung-up for epochs: a collective egoism that never
grows bigger than the couple, the collective of two; the isolated duo, the
nuclear family. We have here the ideology which holds that the egoistic
project could become adequate to itself if only it included two egos. This is
but another form of the ideology of antisocialism; the ideology that seeks to
deny the social ingredient in the individual, the self, the personal world,
and ends up by denying and depleting the self as well; ends up with an emptied
self. According to this ideology, only the personal, intimate, family world,
the private world of the home, is real. The strange, crazy, cold “outside”
world — the social world — is held to be unreal, though it must be related to,
if only to support this narrow “real” world. This ideology knows society only
as an invasion of privacy. This is the ideology that will keep the personal
world narrow and impoverished, and the social world menacing and alien. Will
we get beyond it? Do we want to? Need to? Only time will tell. Capitalist
anti-socialism is now rapidly reaching its logical conclusion: the destruction
of society. Over this question, all of our lives are at stake.

**92.** Freud even bases his case for instinctual repression on the postulate
of such an eternal condition as described above (with the help of a few of his
typical reified[^64] false antitheses).

> “The conflict between civilization and sexuality is caused by the
> circumstance that sexual love is a relationship between two people, in which
> a third can only be superfluous or disturbing, whereas civilization is
> founded on relations between larger groups of persons. When a love
> relationship is at its height no room is left for any interest in the
> surrounding world; the pair of lovers are sufficient unto themselves, do not
> even need the child they have in common to make them happy.”
>

> 1949), pp. 79–80.

Like most calls for moral enforcement, it assumes, unbeknownst to its author
(who characteristically believes, on the contrary, that people already want
too much and are already too selfish) that human greed will not expand beyond
a certain narrow domain.

**93.** The early women's movement was one of the few loci of the nearly
self-conscious emergence of radical subjectivity within the New Left. The
women who created it refused to put off the struggle against their special
oppression until “after the Revolution”.

If human beings have reduced each other to sexual pseudo-objects, have
“objectified”[^65] each other sexually, this is by no means the only or the
most fundamental way in which they have been “objectified”. This is only one
facet of a general dehumanization and de-subjectification. The overcoming of
this specific “objectification”, of the problem posed most subjectively by the
early women's liberation movement, and named “sexism” by the partisans of that
movement, can only be of the form of *sexual subjectivity* as opposed to this
sexual “*objectivity*”, and (expanded) *sexual egoism* as opposed to *sexual
duty*, *sexual self-sacrifice*, and *sexual exploitation*. This solution is
opposed identically to the various directions taken by the later ideological
expropriators of the women's movement; namely that of the abstract negation of
sexism — counter-sexism (anti-masculinism), reverse exploitation through the
ideological manipulation of male guilt, sexual abstinence, or moralistic
lesbianism.

Lately, more and more women have felt called on to act in a new role — that of
“sister.” The joy of the initial abstract unity has been replaced by the
threat of exclusion for unsisterly behavior. Oppression takes a new form:
women over women.

It's not the moments of genuine warmth and intimacy, of authentic community,
within the women's movement that we want to criticize, but precisely the
ideology that ultimately poisoned these.

The “community” founded on gender is still an abstract community, still a
false community; still the domination over the individual and her desires
through the use of abstract categories and external qualities, by the
ideological representatives of these. The pseudo-community of “sisters” —
assumed and moralistically enforced — is still a community founded on
oppression: the repression of radical subjectivity; the representation and
enforcement of an abstract determination defining a group of people in this
case, gender[^66] — over against their concrete particularity and their
conscious *self*-determination.

Bosses come in all genders, no less than in all colors. How much humiliation
will it take to learn that a boss having similar skin color or the same type
of sexual glands “objectifies” one no less than any other? Next time a
feminist bureaucrat addresses you as “Sister”, listen to the tone of her
voice. Why is she whining? Do her words fall like a threat, or like a chain?
What is it she wants from you? Does she want a subject or a slave; a sex,
i.e., a walking abstraction, or a person?

## IX. Authority

**94.** The development of generalized self-management is impeded by,
precisely, *generalized incapacity for self-management* — the terror at the
thought of freedom; frozen subjectivity; the authoritarian personality. This
usually takes the form of a dire fear and distrust of others in a situation of
revolutionary self-management — “the other guy is a fuckup”; “the other guy is
too stupid and irresponsible to ever make it work,” etc. — valid fears, to
which we can only say that everybody is right about everybody else to date.
The authoritarian personality is essentially the *slavish personality*, the
personality that needs authority — that precisely *can't manage without it*.
This character-structure *hides* its essence in the role of the master; it
*reveals* its essence in the role of the slave. Capitalist society is society
founded on the expanded reproduction of the habit of submission, of the
*alienation* (disowning) of subjectivity (wage-labour). The proletarian is
precisely the desubjectified man, the *pseudo-object*, ruled by the
*pseudo-subject*, capital, which he produces and reproduces. Revolutionary
practice is therefore the *practice of “subjectification”*[^67]; of the
expanded reproduction of subjectivity, or radical subjects.[^68] The
*détournement* of moralism (of the pseudo-critique of “greed”), the validation
and expansion of egoism, is thus an essential moment of revolutionary
practice. And this is a moment of that moment.

Beyond the need of authority lies the *authority of needs* and the *authority
of desire*.

**95.** In any hierarchical relationship the dominator as well as the
submissive pays his dues. The price paid for the “glory of command” is indeed
heavy. Every tyrant resents his duties. He is relegated to drag the dead
weight of the dormant creative potential of the submissive all along the road
of his hierarchical excursion. Obviously, this cannot compare to the amount of
pleasure-energy released playfully and willingly, not coercively, when
*everyone* plays the game. (The price of one's authority over others is the
sum total of one's acceptance of the same authority over oneself.)

**96.** In a self-managed society, the prevention of communal squalor, of
social malpractice in general (the nonfulfillment of production-plans, etc.)
depends, not on *nobody* being an authority, but on *everybody* being an
authority where his own needs and desires, his own interests, are concerned.
And this means *expanded* self-interests; *social* self-interests. This means
that *anybody* must be self-authorized to mess with *anybody else* befouling a
communal place, impeding collectively agreed-upon production, etc., and must
*know how* to do so. Only such a non-centralized, all-sided flow of
practical-critical feedback and social dialogue can reproduce such a society.
The end of specialized supervision can only be in the process of generalized
supervision and collective self-supervision. The end of the special police
depends on *general* self-regulation, that is, *generalized self-management* —
*people* taking responsibility for their social needs. This is the opposite of
the repressive conception, “self-policing” based on the present *external*
policing, which serves an *alien* interest, and is internalized *as such*.

**97.** In the socialist society of the future — if it is to be at all —
everyone will have to be his own expert, his own authority, on *savoir-vivre*,
on “how-to-live”. There will be no higher authority over a given matter than
the general assembly of those self-interested in that matter.

**98.** Every treatise on the theory of practice is a *Traité de
Savoir-Vivre*[^69], a “Treatise on How to Live”, whether its author fully
knows it or not. “How-to-live” is just the general problem of the theory of
practice *stated most subjectively*.

**99.** Freedom from external authority means being your own authority;
*self-authority*. Freedom = self-mastery. The meaning of the phrase “a world
of masters without slaves”[^70] can be conceived only in the concept of
self-mastery. But this cannot be limited to “individual” self-mastery. The
concept of individual self-mastery already necessarily includes the moment of
*social* self-mastery. Communist society can only mean the conscious
self-mastery of the totality of their social self-production by the associated
producers. Self-determination, self-government, self-management — in their
necessary, *completed* meaning, can mean nothing less. The general name of the
problem we confront is “to learn how to live,” i.e. *socially*, how to
“*associate*”. “Live” here is opposed to merely surviving, and to dying
supposedly trying to live (the “beautiful losers” syndrome), etc. But this has
nothing to do with morality — nothing, that is, but to *abolish* it!

## X. Morality

**100.** The old moral question of whether one “thinks first of oneself or of
others” falls apart when we come to *think only of ourselves* and *for this
reason* negate the *otherness* of others.

**101.** Intelligence ends where morality begins. Morality ends where
intelligence begins. The theory of practice, the unitary critique of all
ideology, must at the same time be the critique not only of *any* moralism,
but of *any possible* moralism. Every moral is subjectivity disowned and
subjectivity alienated. Every moral is a psychic totem, a mental
fetish-object, before which the moral fetishist subordinates himself, bows
down, and offers sacrifice — indeed offers *himself* in sacrifice. Every ideal
is separated subjectivity; a part of the self separated off, ejected, frozen,
and held *over* the rest of the self. It is a depletion of subjectivity, a
loss of freedom, a choice made in advance. The formation of the moral ideal is
at the same time a decline in subjective mobility and maneuverability; a
ball-and-chain about the dancer's ankle; a self-laming and self-maiming in the
dance of life.

**102.** Morality and that which ties you to it, self-guilt, guilt for even
being, is an enormous encumbrance. You can throw it off! You can drop all that
weighty moral baggage, before it drags you down! You don't need it! It is but
a poor substitute for the fine tool of practical intelligence, expanded
self-interest, self-consciousness itself.

When, if I should encounter a contradiction between a useful abstraction I had
made about my practice, and my concrete self-interest in a given situation, if
I abandon my concrete desire in favor of the practice of that abstraction,
that *mere* generalization, out of abstract respect for superficial
“consistency”, or, say, at the behest of another, who threatens me with the
word “hypocrite”, then I am projecting that abstraction into a position above
myself, freezing it into a “principle”[^71], a moral, and I am reproducing as
an ideologue the other person who has rebuked me in comparison to that moral,
by being susceptible to him expropriating the *representation of myself* which
I have erected or condoned, and using it *against my real self*. As a mere
generalization, *a practical abstraction* — as theory — I have already refuted
it *for myself* in practice, proven its invalidity *for this instance*. But as
a *moral reification*, on the contrary, it is my *duty* to *obey* it. Not I
but “it” is my master: “it” gives the orders, I alienate my will into it; “it”
is the *subject* of my practice, I “its” *object*.

**103.** The projections of my subjectivity, nurtured by guilt, stick out of
my head like so many handles offered to any manipulator, any ideologue, who
wants to get a hold of me, and whose *trade skill* is the ability to perceive
such handles.

Only when I dissolve my guilt, when I free myself to be *shamelessly selfish*,
when I grasp *selfishness as my only “duty”* — taking care of myself as
necessarily my first *social* responsibility — can I be free.

**104.** The critique of the totemic relationship, clarified by Feuerbach[^72]
in relation to religion, thence applied to political economy by Marx[^73], and
lately developed one-sidedly by the Gestalt therapists (especially Perls[^74])
locates the inversion that lies at the heart of all domination and
*self*-enslavement. Totemic fetishism or projection lies also at the heart of
every moral ideology, which is revealed also in the observation that every
ideology is a moralism, and a social plan for the allocation of guilt. While
usable precisely for the same ends, ideology in general, moralism in
particular, are in essence the more sophisticated and subtle *means of
exploitation*, as opposed to *naked coercion*.

**105.** It is my guilt about my desires which makes me susceptible to
ideological exploitation by others, and which motivates me in producing
excuses and justifications (rationalizations) in terms of the dominant
ideology (the ideology which I let dominate me). The trick of ideology
consists in this: to re-present desires in a pseudo-universal — i.e.,
unselfish, altruistic — and therefore unreproachable, form, always in terms of
some abstract “general interest”. In order to reconcile myself with my
ideology I must make myself a liar. But it is a losers' game. The lawyers of
the dominant class already have it set up in advance their way, and here I am
on their terrain. The use-value of practical generalizations is that of
*theory* — intelligence of human practice; knowledge of means, techniques, and
consequences. The use-value of morality is that of ideology — to dominate
others, to attempt to get what is wanted in a *narrowly* selfish way, by
representing it as unselfish, universal, in a climate where transparent
selfishness, and transparency about desires, is not tolerated, is *chastised*.

**106.** In the abstract negation of morality, its mere antithesis — typical
especially of the *Situationist mentality* — moralism is transformed into
anti-moralism, which is really only an anti-moralism moralism, and not truly
the opposite of moralism at all. According to the logical substructure of this
ideology, one has a duty to do at all times what is immoral according to the
dominant ideology — that is, the ideology by which the Situationist still
defines and dominates himself, though here in a negative form. Thus, it is
*abstractly* required to live by stealing, to practice sexual promiscuity, to
live in squalor, to drop out of school, to never work, etc., etc. This is
still qualitatively as far from the determinate negation of moralism as is
moralism itself.

**107.** As for ourselves, we have no morality. We have only our feelings, our
needs, our desires; our thoughts, our consciousness, our practical knowledge
of practical consequences, at each given stage of our development. In short,
our subjectivities, our selves. Compassion doesn't need to be coerced out of
us; it comes naturally. We feel others' suffering, as well as their joy,
because we are open to feeling our own.

As with religion, so with respect to the other projections (individual and
collective, commodities, money, capital, the state, ideologies of every
description, morality in particular, reified [hierarchical] institutions of
all sorts — pseudo-subjects all). Try substituting them in!

**109.**

>
> — Karl Marx, *Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right*,
> ‘Introduction’.[^75]

**110.** The criticism of morality ends with the doctrine that you are the
supreme being *for you*. (That is, your being, your self-consciousness, your
being-for-yourself, is the necessary medium through which all other values —
which constitute or give content to its value — including my value for you, or
myself as one of your values, come into being for you. If you should lose your
being, then all other beings, and therewith all values, would be lost *to
you*. Further, and more concretely, to the extent that we produce socially,
and that we produce a society; that we exchange self-powers and their
objectifications, that we depend upon one another for the reproduction of
ourselves, then my loss, or the loss of me, is your loss, and a depletion of
your self). It ends, therefore, with the categorical imperative to overthrow
all those conditions under which you, the subject, are subordinated to some
*thing* — some fetish, some totem, some projection, some reification, some
cause, some ideal, some moral, some principle, some pseudo-subject — some
being supposedly “higher than your self.”

**111.** What cause or ideal is there, what projection out of yourself, that
can be higher, for *you*, than you, its source? What external to your self
that you value can warrant for you your sacrifice? What value is there that
you would not lose if you lost yourself? Something can be a value for you only
if it includes and conserves in it your self, the necessary foundation of all
your values. When you are lost to you, all the emanations of yourself, and all
the values in the world that you affirmed, are lost for you also; cut off at
their root.

Taking risks is another matter. You must gamble your self in order to gain
*any* value; you must risk yourself in order to gain yourself back again more
richly. What is called cowardice is not the practice of the realization
expressed above, but its opposite: too little value placed on one's self, and
on those values and other persons which are *part of it*, so that one fails to
defend one's self *in the expanded sense*, or mistakes mere *survival* for
life.

**112.** It is not by any means only the narrowly “selfish”, “egoistic”
desires and tendencies which are repressed continually (*moralistically*,
while at the same time being reinforced *practically*) in the daily life of
privatized society, but also — really, more so — the “non-egoistic”, the
so-called “unselfish” tendencies: natural gregariousness, spontaneous human
solidarity, natural compassion and empathy, simple sociability and love. There
is an energy produced in each human being every day which aims at a social
satisfaction and which if not satisfied socially turns against itself, becomes
depression, withdrawal, etc. Unlike tribal societies, wherein these “unselfish
tendencies” form the main base of social survival, in our society,
overdeveloped (late) capitalist society, these emotions only break surface
occasionally, *exceptionally*. In the vast accumulations of constant and
variable capital[^76] known today as “cities”, the continual steadfast
repression of these tendencies is increasingly a necessity of survival. With
increasing rarity does social good-feeling pass between strangers on the
street. Any stranger is best regarded an enemy. And these teeming anthills are
a *world of strangers*. The growing phenomenon of mass, random murders can be
understood as a becoming apparent of what was always essential to capitalist
society, now entering its historic extremity: “the war of all against all” is
becoming armed.[^77]

Once anesthetized, beginning in the early life of the individual, these social
desires and tendencies can usually be re-evoked only falsely, artificially,
*coercively*. Hence the belief that these emotions need to be enforced through
the manipulation of guilt. Anyone still manifesting such tendencies in their
direct, spontaneous form into young adulthood is immediately suspect, or at
best, considered “naive” and a “fool” for his apparent “idealism” and/or
“childishness” (despite all the altruistic *pretenses* of official society):
these emotional tendencies are being seen as a weakness (which, in the society
of estrangement, they undoubtedly *are*, until or unless such an individual
develops full consciousness of these tendencies and of their social context,
appropriating these as part of a revolutionary project).

**113.** I listen to criticism because I am *greedy*. I listen to criticism
because I am *selfish*. I would not deny myself another's insights. But
egoistic criticism is a use-value or it is nothing; use-value not only to its
recipient, but to its donor as well. I would not bother to criticize someone
in whom I had no interest. Anything else would be service rendered to an
ideal, a moral projection — only a moralist seeks to strike against what
contradicts him, his moral, equally over the whole manifold of space-time;
only an ideal is “eternal” in this way. Whereas I am mortal. My libido is
concentrated around myself; its intensity falls off exponentially with
*subjective* distance from its source.

This egoistic criticism is the opposite of the masochistic and ritualized
(spectacular) “criticism and self-criticism” of Maoist morality.
*Authoritarian criticism* aims at my *repression*, at reinforcing and
reproducing *passivity* and servility, at maintaining the habit of submission.
It aims at weakening, rather than strengthening, my subjectivity, at keeping
me an authoritarian personality — a *slave*. Egoistic criticism, on the
contrary, aims at strengthening me, in the mutual interest of my self and my
critic, for the benefit of our *common wealth* and our *common project*. It is
*immanent* criticism, criticism of me *in my own interest*. By the same token,
for such criticism to be possible, for someone's criticism to “interest” me, I
must see myself in them, and them in myself; we must share a common interest,
a concrete community.

**114.** The critique of revolutionary ideology, anarchist and Leninist alike,
with its *sacrificial collectivist* morality and, in particular, the critique
of Maoism with its *morality of poverty*, reveals once and for all the
*poverty of all morality*.

And this in a double sense. *First*, in that morality is the ideological
product of poverty; of the underdeveloped state of human productive forces,
and especially of the cleavage of the “general” and “particular” interests,
whose root is the self-cleavage of society; social classes. Morality is the
expression of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms. It locates the
general interest as a *projection* out of a social situation *in* which it
could only be found as a *contradiction*. In morality, the contradiction is
represented as an abstract identity of the interests of all men, as the
interest of an *abstract man* who has no real social existence. *Second*, in
the sense that morality — which is projection, or self-disowning — is a
depletion of the real social wealth, of subjectivity, the wealth of the self.

**115.** Our subjectivity and our self-rediscovery in every here and now, i.e.
our self-reproduction, is the only possible guarantee of our subjectivity. We
must re-win ourselves constantly. “Communist egoism” can be made into an
ideology. “The right to be greedy” can be turned into a morality. Easily. *No*
objectification is immune. This ideology begins whenever some bureaucrat — for
this act would confirm him so being — tries to order me, in the name of my
“self-interest,” to desist from some activity I have freely undertaken, on the
grounds that it is *“objectively”* sacrificial, and *I let* *him get away with
it.*(Here is revealed the *lie*of representation: he represents me even
against myself — he owns “me”, is more “me” than I am.) If I keep this up, the
final scenario can be easily envisioned: some bureaucrat points a gun at me
saying: “In the name of your expanded self-interest, that of the proletariat
as a whole, we have determined that it is best for you for us to kill you” and
pulls the trigger. (cf. Kronstadt, the ideology of the National Caucus of
Labor Committees, etc.).[^78]

**116.** In a revolutionary situation it takes much more than the mere *wish*
to prevent a bureaucracy from arising. The roots of bureaucracy lie in
personal self denial[^79], in treating myself and my desires in a bureaucratic
manner, in short, being a bureaucrat with myself. The mere abstract negation
of its institutionalized form is like arriving with a bucket of water after
the house has already burned down. In every rationalization and hesitation, in
every stuttering and swallowing down of desire, of felt resentments,
miscommunications and secret humiliations lie the seeds of our demise, our
Thermidor. The logical outgrowth of any self denial by any revolutionary is
the triumph of the counter-revolution and the reign of the Bolsheviks all over
again.

The moment you sit by passively while not getting what you want, you are
preparing the ground for your own destruction.

**117.** We are on the verge of liberation only when it can be said of each of
us that he/she has become so rebellious, so irrepressible, and so unruly that
she/he cannot be *mastered* by anything less than his/her *self*. (i.e., among
other things, when no mere projection or reification of a *part* of ourselves
will suffice, any longer, or will be able successfully to rule over us.)

**118.** The “game”[^80] is a form of armour, ideology is a “game”,
character-armour is compulsive role-playing, the “script” is the self-image
projected through time, the temporalized self-spectacle. In the white heat of
the act of their comprehension as lived experience and as interpersonal praxis
going on all around us, these names, and the concepts they name game, armour,
ideology, role, character, script melt into one.

The self-spectacle, the spectacular self — *self-representation* — will be
found necessary, a necessary use-value, a necessary interpersonal tool, in
fact, a “survival kit”, and thus be reproduced, so long as (1) the *dissonance
of egoisms*, the totality of conditions known in general as “poverty”,
“scarcity”, prevails, and consequently, (2) people cannot get what they want
often enough by being transparent with one another, by simply *asking for
it,*and, (3) they cannot or will not take the risk of asking, the gamble of
transparency, either for fear of the pain of refusal or out of the desperation
of their need, and would therefore prefer to extract what they can by
circuitous means, by subterfuge and deception, decoy and trickery — in short,
by intransparent means.

The spectacular presentation of self in everyday life, the personal
organization of false appearances (*persona*) — partly compulsive and
involuntary, as especially in muscle armour — the little lie — these are the
means of the *devious* route to the realization of desire. In their conscious
part, they will be resorted to so long as the more direct means, transparency,
does not work any better. In their more unconscious, compulsive part, they are
the mark of repression and domination, the cowering wince of the whipped cur,
frozen into a posture.

Character-armour is indeed the form of peoples' complicity in the spectacle.
Not that feeling guilty about one's character-armour will do anything but
exacerbate this problem.

**120.** In the end, egoism is our only friend; in the last analysis greed is
the only thing we can trust. Any revolutionary who is to be counted on can
only be in it for *himself*: *un*selfish people can always switch loyalty from
one projection to another. Furthermore, only the most greedy people can be
relied on to follow through on their revolutionary project. Others less greedy
can always be bought off so as to stop short of *themselves*.

**121.** The practical necessity of greed and the truth of our statements
concerning the failures engendered by greed which is not greedy enough are
demonstrated continually in the history of the modern revolutionary movement.
Just as, in 1871, internalized ideology and a miserable handful of guards were
enough to deter the armed Communards from seizing the French National Bank at
a time when money was desperately needed, so in 1968 French insurgents
(mystified by trade-unionist and anarcho-syndicalist ideology) failed to
comprehend all the world around them as *social property* (and therefore
*theirs*) and thus tended to restrict self-organization to “their own” work
places. Though greedy and egoistic in their own right, both these movements
fell victim to the mystification, the fetishism of privatized territory. In
both cases, the revolutionaries were left in paltriness, the pathetic
possessors of mere fragments of a revolution (these fragments by their very
nature sublated into naught). In both cases it was a limited greed, in their
theory and their spirit, that led to the practical (indeed even military)
*defeat* of these revolutions. The meaning of Marx's “I am nothing, but I must
be everything” unfolds its truth fully when we realize that only when we
become everything shall we cease to be nothing.

**122.**

> — *graffito*, Paris, May–June, 1968.[^81]

**123.** The *social* revolution is when social human beings, social
individuals *wake up* inside the living, waking nightmare of privatized life.

**124.** Revolution is the *social* moment of the collapse of all projections.
In the moment of *social* revolution, the present, the *historical* present,
*the presence of history* opens up like the sky.

**125.** Don't be *too* afraid. What is left after the collapse of all
projections is you, your self, precisely that in you which alone was *not*
self-projection. Don't panic — you've been lost so long, it may take you a
moment, after the deluge, to find your self again, there at the center of
everything. *Après le déluge, moi!* After the deluge: you!

And your self will not be found alone.

**126.** The road to further evolution passes through revolution. The path
that leads from survival to life passes through the valley of the shadow of
death. We have decided to go, to take the gamble, for ourselves. Do you want
to come with us, for yourself? We want you. We need you. You decide.

## Appendix: Preamble to the Founding Agreements

We have woken up to discover that our lives are becoming unlivable. From
boring, meaningless jobs to the humiliation of waiting endlessly in lines, at
desks and counters to receive our share of survival, from prison-like schools
to repetitious, mindless “entertainment,” from desolate and crime-ridden
streets to the stifling isolation of home, our days are a treadmill on which
we run faster and faster just to keep the same pace.

Like the immense majority of the population, we have no control over the use
to which our lives are put: we are people who have nothing to sell but our
capacity to work. We have come together because we can no longer tolerate the
way we are forced to exist, we can no longer tolerate being squeezed dry of
our energies, being used up and thrown away, only to create a world that grows
more alien and ugly every day.

The system of Capital, whether in its “Western” private corporate or “Eastern”
state-bureaucratic form, was brutal and exploitative even during its ascent:
now, where it is in decay, it poisons air and water, produces goods and
services of deteriorating quality, and is less and less able to employ us even
to its own advantage. Its logic of accumulation and competition leads
inexorably toward its own collapse. Even as it links all the people of the
world together in one vast network of production and consumption, it isolates
us from each other; even as it stimulates greater and greater advances in
technology and productive power, it finds itself incapable of putting them to
use: even as it multiplies the possibilities for human self-realization, we
find ourselves strangled in layers of guilt, fear and self-contempt.

But it is we *ourselves* — our strength, our intelligence, our creativity, our
passions — that are the greatest productive power of all. It is we who produce
and reproduce the world as it is, in the image of Capital; it is we who
reinforce in each other the conditioning of family, school, church and media,
the conditioning that keeps us slaves. When we decide together to end our
misery, to take our lives into our own hands, we can recreate the world the
way we want it. The technical resources and worldwide productive network
developed under the old system give us the means: the crisis and continuing
collapse of that system give us the chance and the urgent need.

The ruling ideologies of the world superpowers, with their interlocking sets
of lies, offer us only the false choice of “Communism” versus “Capitalism.”
But in the history of revolution during this century (Russia, 1905; Germany,
191920; Spain, 1936–37; Hungary, 1956) we have discovered the general form
through which we can take back power over our own lives: *workers' councils*.
At their highest moments, these councils were popular assemblies in workplaces
and communities, joined together by means of strictly mandated delegates who
carried out decisions *already made* by their assemblies and who could be
recalled by them at any time. The councils organized their own defense and
restarted production under their own management. By now, through a system of
councils at the local, regional, and global level, using modern
telecommunications and data processing, we can coordinate and plan world
production as well as be free to shape our own immediate environment. Any
compromise with bureaucracy and official hierarchy, anything short of the
total power of workers' councils, can only reproduce misery and alienation in
a new form, as a good look at the so-called “Communist” countries will show.
For this reason, no political party can represent the revolutionary movement
or seize power “on its behalf,” since this would be simply a change of ruling
classes, not their abolition. The plan of the freely associated producers is
in absolute opposition to the dictatorial Plan of state and corporate
production. *Only all of us together can decide what is best for us*.

For these reasons, we call upon you and upon all the hundreds of millions like
you and us, to join us in the revolutionary transformation of every aspect of
life. We want to abolish the system of wage and salaried labor, of commodity
exchange-value and of profit, of corporate and bureaucratic power. We want to
decide the nature and conditions of everything we do, to manage all social
life collectively and democratically. We want to end the division of mental
from manual work and of “free” time from work time, by bringing into play all
of our abilities for enjoyable creative activity. We want the whole world to
be our conscious self-creation, so that our days are full of wonder, learning,
and pleasure. *Nothing less*.

In setting down this minimum program, we are not trying to impose an ideal on
reality, nor are we alone in wanting what we want. Our ideas are already in
everyone's minds, consciously or unconsciously, because they are nothing but
an expression of the *real movement* that exists all over the planet. But in
order to win, this movement must know itself, its aims, *and its enemies*, as
never before.

We do not speak for this movement, but for ourselves as of it. We recognize no
Cause over and above ourselves. But our selves are already *social*: the whole
human race produces the life of each one of its members, now more than ever
before. Our aim is simply to make this process conscious for the first time,
to give to the production of human life the imaginative intensity of a work of
art.

It is in this spirit that we call upon you to organize, as we are doing, where
you work and where you live, to begin planning the way we can run society
together, to defend yourselves against the deepening misery that is being
imposed on all of us. We call upon you to assault actively the lies, the
selfdeceptions born of fear, that keep everyone frozen in place while the
world is falling apart around us. We call upon you to link up with us and with
others who are doing the same thing. Above all, we call upon you to take
yourselves and your desires seriously, to realize your own power to master
your own lives.

It is now or never. If we are to have a future, we ourselves must be that
future.

**FOR OURSELVES!**

[^1]: By “transparent” relations we mean relations beyond duplicity; relations
    in which the essential is also visible, i.e., in which the essence
    appears. “Transparency” is when you can see from the surface of social
    phenomena through into their core; when their truth is apparent on the
    surface. On the contrary, the social relations of capitalist society are
    opaque; shot through with a contradiction between appearance and essence;
    things are, more often than not the exact opposite of what they appear to
    be. For example, in capital, the apparent social imperative of the
    production of maximal use-value — “we're here to serve you”; “to produce a
    quality product”, etc. — conceals their ulterior motive of the production
    of maximal exchange-value (profit), and this hidden, essential imperative
    reveals itself only *where the two imperatives* come into conflict, in
    *which case the use-value is sacrificed to exchange-value* (planned
    obsolescence, production of worthless products, fad products, destruction
    of crops and other products to keep prices up, and in general, the
    tendency of all products produced as commodity-capital to deteriorate in
    quality over time; the “tendency of use-value to fall.” Marx envisioned
    the emergence of transparency in social relations as an aspect of the
    emergence of communist society, in the following words:

    > individuals, carrying on their work with the means of production in

    > The social relations of the individual producers, with regard both to
    > their labour and to its products, are in this case perfectly simple and
    > intelligible, and that with regard not only to production but also to
    > distribution […] (mystification] can, in any case, only then finally
    > vanish, when the practical relations of everyday life offer to man none
    > but perfectly intelligible and reasonable relations with regard to his
    > fellowmen and to Nature […]”

    Generally, character-armor may be viewed as frozen modes of otherwise
    normal behavior — the point is the inability of an individual to choose or
    to change certain aspects of his behavior. Metaphorically, it is the
    unseen shield that blocks expression and perception of a person's “core”,
    their subjectivity, keeping it from the surface and usually from
    consciousness. It is the inauthentic self — the fictitious or *non-*self —
    that conceals and harbors the real self.

    The involuntary modes of behavior that characterize armor are generally
    “learned” during childhood as a “rational” response to an irrational,
    oppressive world. Thus, armor is essentially not a thing located in each
    individual, but a social relation, a layer of callous, deadened to the
    self and other, built up in the wear and tear of (anti-)social
    interactions; in the agony and constant danger of alienated association.
    This is demonstrated in the following observation: change a person's
    social relations and his armouring, his character adjustment, will also
    begin to change to re-adapt, to become congruent again with his social
    life, his new relationships. Thus, it is erroneous to locate armour
    *simply* in the individual taken separately, although it is true that his
    social relations, his way of relating and surviving socially, may be
    “reflected” — mapped onto his body — in the form of *muscular armouring*;
    of a pattern of chronic contraction in the various muscular segments.

    Character-armour is thus (1) the personal aspect of the spectacle. It is
    the personal organization of false appearances: self-representation; the
    self-spectacle. It is the self-image one seeks to project to others; the
    “front” one puts up; the role one plays: the “reputation” one accumulates.
    The projected, surface motives belonging to character are at the same time
    a surface denial and repression of certain forbidden, impermissible
    motives, which persist beneath the surface of character as ulterior
    motives, conscious or not. In their more conscious part, these ulterior
    motives express themselves as character in the form of lying, cheating,
    trickery, the con, hypocrisy, etc. — all the familiar backstage of the
    spectacle of “good character.” Character is the very locus of
    interpersonal duplicity — precisely the “duplication” of the self (cf.
    Karl Marx, ‘Theses on Feuerbach’, thesis IV, in *The German Ideology*,
    Progress Publishers (Moscow, 1968). p. 666, see also Marx's remark in his
    *Preface to A Contribution To The Critique of Political Economy*: “Just as
    our opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so
    we can not judge of such a period of transformation by its own
    consciousness.” in Lewis Feuer, op. cit., p. 44.)

    Character-armour is also (2) the personal aspect of capital. In the
    proletarian, character is the locus of his “nature” as a commodity, his
    use-value to capital as an obedient pseudo-object, and hence his
    exchange-value — his exploitability — as “labour-power”; as a worker.
    Character-armour is the encrustation surrounding his self; a shield
    shielding both the world and his pseudo-self from his own potential
    subjectivity. It is built up through long years of social labour-time
    bestowed upon him by other individuals — his parents, priests, school
    teachers, policeman, and authorities of every sort, including his own peer
    group — and is part of the labour time socially necessary to produce a
    usable proletarian wretch from the available human raw-material, hence is
    included in the (exchange-) value of labour-power. It is the “value-added”
    to the individual as he “matures” by the labour of the social authorities,
    the immediate and (semi-conscious) agents of class society, who must see
    to the reproduction of individuals characterologically congruent with
    Capitalist social relations: with capital. The production-process of
    character must thus be comprehended within the critique of political
    economy, as an aspect of the reproduction-process of capital, of
    capitalist society, as a whole. This process, the production process of
    proletarians, a special form of commodity production carried out in
    special factories known as “schools”, “churches”, “prisons”, “families”,
    etc., is usually referred to, in general, as “child-rearing”, “education”,
    or “socialization”. It consists in (a) the destruction of subjectivity in
    its direct form, and (b) the development of a narrow form of subjectivity,
    in an indirect (perverted) form, mediated by authoritarian permission. It
    is the totality of the processes of “adaptation” necessary to make the
    proletarian “fit” to endure the “life” of a worker. When the process
    miscarries, as it often does these days, the product is said to be
    “unemployable” — useless to capital. In the “finished” product, the adult,
    character-armour is the repository, the objectification of this process,
    the location of all the stored programs, habits, practices, roles, and
    behavior patterns necessary to the proletarian survival kit —
    submissiveness, slavishness, self-contempt, passivity, obedience,
    irresponsibility, guilt, fear of freedom, and so on. Character-armour is
    the layer of frozen subjectivity that makes the worker functional as a
    worker in capitalist society, i.e., manipulatable as a pseudo-object. It
    is what makes the worker *suitable* for authoritarian management. It is
    what makes him (presently) *incapable* of self-management. The way through
    the problem is to have people not armored but “armed” — physically,
    psychologically, and theoretically — to bring what is involuntary more
    under conscious control.

[^5]: By “Power” with a capital “P”, we mean separate power; alienated power,
    whose major modern examples are state power and that social power known as
    “capital”. In state-capitalism, the highest form of capitalism, these two,
    always interpenetrate essentially, become one visibly. In pre-modern
    times, in Medieval Europe, the Church would be another example of separate
    social power.

    We have no quarrel with “power” as such, that is, with self-power — the
    power of social self-determination and self-production; creative,
    productive faculties and power over one's own life. On the contrary; this
    is the very development and enrichment of individuality itself. On the
    contrary; the re-appropriation of ourselves, the repossession of ourselves
    from capital, the re-owning of alienated self-powers, is the essential
    purpose of our revolution, the communist revolution; and is our purpose in
    it. It should be obvious, then, from what has been said, that Power is the
    opposite of power. The greater the Power of the State and Capital, the
    more powerless, the more impotent are we, the proletariat, for that Power
    is nothing other than our lost, our *alienated power*; the labour power we
    sell to capital and the political power we give up to our
    “representatives”.

    It was necessary to say this because of the legions of moralistic
    masochists and worshippers of impotence presently traipsing through the
    spectacle, for whom we might otherwise have been mistaken. These
    self-castrated passivists believe that not just Power, but power also,
    corrupts, *absolutely*, and desperately “fear to touch it”, along with
    money and capital, out of dread of being instantly corrupted by it. They
    have never let themselves grasp that the only way to be safe from this
    pathetic “corruption” is to be — not beneath it, but *beyond* it.

    For an account, unsurpassed in its brilliance, of the dialectic of
    self-powers and their alienation, see Lorraine and Fredy Perlman's
    book-length détournement of revolutionary ideology, *Manual For
    Revolutionary Leaders*, “by Michael Velli” (Black and Red, P.O. Box 9546,
    Detroit, Michigan, 48202; pp. 11–49). (Unfortunately for all of us, the
    Perlmans decided to truncate their theory just at the threshold of its
    practice, by abstractly negating revolutionary organization — to the
    effect that all organization is hierarchical organization and all
    revolutionary organization is necessarily Leninist organization — and so
    end up embracing impotence for themselves as revolutionaries).

[^6]: From here on out, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the use of
    masculine pronoun forms is meant to include the feminine, since this is
    the closest thing to a unitary pronoun the English language contains, for
    most purposes.

[^7]: Immanent critique is critique which bases itself in the same foundation,
    logical, etc., which forms the *core* or essence of the object of the
    critique; critique which locates itself *inside* its object. It thus
    locates the *internal* contradictions of its object — the
    *self*-contradictions — becoming a critique which is *essential* to the
    object of critique itself. Thus immanent critique is an intimate, internal
    critique, in fact, a *self*-critique of the object, a critique based on
    the internal standards of the object of the critique itself, and not an
    external or alien critique — a judgment from a standpoint outside that
    which is judged.

[^8]: By “total appropriation” we mean, in general, *all-sided appropriation*
    — that is, social relations not restricted to a specialized and
    compartmentalized interchange of “things” or of parts of people as
    “things” (money, commodities, images, etc.) — as in the present
    organization of social interaction according to roles, which enforces a
    strict separation of the various aspects and interests of life. “Total
    appropriation” is, among other things, where you are no longer confined to
    “talking shop” *even in the shop*.

    By “total” appropriation of another person we mean, in particular, an
    appropriation of them which included in itself *their appropriation of
    you*; i.e. it can occur only when it is reciprocal, when each person is
    both appropriat*or* and appropriat*ed*. This is unlike either the case of
    the appropriation of an *object*, which can't “appropriate back,” or the
    *partial* appropriation (exploitation) of a *subject*; the appropriation
    of a subject *as if* an object, *excluding*, disregarding his or her
    desires, needs, expectations, and *reciprocal appropriation* of the
    appropriator. That is, we would mean that you appropriate their
    appropriation of you as itself a necessary part of them; include in the
    “them” that you “totally” appropriate their desires, needs, attitudes, and
    expectations with regard to you in some way; appropriate their
    subjectivity *as the essential part of them*; relate to it. “Total
    appropriation” is thus the encounter by a subject of another subject *as a
    subject*. It would involve the appropriation of the other person’s
    response to you, including of their response to your responses to them.
    True infinity. Total appropriation exists when you can (actually and
    directly — not just vicariously) appropriate someone else's joy as your
    own.

    One might very well say that there is plenty about contemporary “subjects”
    that one not only doesn't want to appropriate ‘totally’, but in fact
    doesn't want any part of. And to this we could only agree, with however
    the additional commentary that (1) most of what we don't want any part of
    is non-self, non-subjectivity (frozen subjectivity; armour) to begin with,
    and: (2) this negated subjectivity has to be dealt with in one way or
    another anyway: no matter what, it has to be faced, even in present-day
    society — perhaps 90% of the fuck-ups in present-day capitalist
    business-practice are due to such characterological “personality factors”.
    And in the context of associated production, where sustained association
    is an egoistic necessity, the problem becomes a question of what is the
    best way of confronting these “factors”, from an expanded-egoistic point
    of view. There is no doubt that “total appropriation” will be, among other
    things, a conflictual process, a fight. Direct “appropriation” — i.e.,
    here-and-now contestation — of such “personality kinks” as they come up in
    the social (re)productive process, rather than in their avoidance or
    polite toleration which bespeaks an attitude of resignation to the person
    tolerated as a static being incapable of further self-development, and to
    the person tolerating as impotent to provoke change — can, where
    appropriate, render daily social interaction itself an accelerated
    “psychotherapeutic” growth process.

    Expanded egoism, that is, total appropriation, is a process. Only as
    exploitation in social relations lives out its use-value will we begin to
    develop expanded egoism concretely. At the beginnings of communist
    society, radical subjectivity will not miraculously manifest itself in
    everyone, at the same time, to the same degree of intensity or
    sustainedness. The development will be an irregular process. To abstractly
    affirm an idyllic, non-conflictual image of total appropriation of another
    when in fact the other remains to varying degrees a frozen subject is to
    morally project and idealize total appropriation.

    Total appropriation is a social-historical process which grows out of
    people's collective transformation of the world and themselves. The fact
    that we feel a need for such transparency shows that the process has
    already begun. But already this process has come into conflict with the
    objective conditions (i.e. the present social relations). Ultimately, only
    in revolution can we succeed in ridding ourselves of all the muck of ages
    and become fitted to found society anew.

[^9]: By “egoism” we mean something which, in its full development, is quite
    different from, in fact, “infinitely” different from or opposite to
    “egotism”. Egotism is personal practice in favor of one's self-spectacle,
    one's social image, one's *persona*. It is precisely, therefore, activity
    in the interest of one's non-self, truly selfless activity. Whereas, by
    egoism we mean, on the contrary, personal activity in the interest of
    one's authentic self, to the extent one recognizes and knows this self at
    any given time, however narrowly or expandedly. Egotism is spectacular,
    other-centered (alienated), the vicarious living of your own life; egoism
    is autonomous, founded on self-centration and on concrete, social
    self-knowledge. Egotism is thus one of the lowest forms of egoism. It is,
    like moralism, egoism by means of a projection, and turns into into its
    opposite.

[^10]: The term “détournement”, employed especially as a technical term by
    Situationists, has been defined as the revolutionary practice “by which
    the spectacle is turned back on itself, turned inside out so that it
    reveals its own inner workings.” See *Loaded Words: A Rebel's Guide to
    Situationese*, New Morning, February, 1973, New Morning Collective (P.O.
    Box 531, Berkeley, California, 94701), p. 14.

    This mode of practice is not confined merely to the
    turning-against-themselves of the words, the language, of spectacular
    ideology. The technique has also been applied to the momentary seizure of
    the spectacular images of various dominant ideologies and institutions for
    the purpose of broadcasting through said images a revolutionary critique.
    Such “momentary expropriation” of the means of communication has been
    used, for example, in cases where fraudulent memorandums attributed to
    prominent bureaucrats, posters announcing events or opinions in the name
    of dominant spectacular organizations, press releases and other works
    attributed to government officials or other spectacular (imaged)
    personages, issues of newspapers or other periodicals, advertising
    materials, etc. have been disseminated and the resulting scandal or
    confusion of denials used as a lever to gain publicity for revolutionary
    theory.

[^11]: Words — written and spoken — are, in the beginning, the only means of
    production which we, as proletarians, possess: the very means of
    production of revolutionary consciousness itself.

[^15]: The phrases “the associated producers”, “free and associated labor”, or
    “the associated workers”, occur again and again throughout Marx's works
    when he seeks to name or characterize the social relation of production of
    communist society: association itself. This is something that Leninists of
    every variety scrupulously avoid mentioning for, with all their talk of
    the “socialist state” and “workers' governments”, etc. they would much
    rather all this be conveniently forgotten. No more apt phrase could be
    contrived to name and describe the management of society as a system of
    workers' councils than precisely “the associated producers”. A few
    selected citations of representative passages where this description
    occurs, are listed below:

[^16]: Workers' councils have emerged historically as a revolutionary force
    beginning with the Paris Commune of 1871, where they took the form of a
    community council without workplace councils (given the underdeveloped
    state of the factory system in the Paris of that time); in Russia in 1905
    and again in 1917 in the form of city-wide (and later nationwide) Soviets,
    and factory committees; in Germany during 1918–1919 as the classical
    Soldiers' and Workers' councils'; in Italy in 1920 (the Turin Soviet,
    etc.); in the Kronstadt Soviet of 1921; in Spain during 1936–37 in the
    form of the Catalonian workers' councils and peasant cooperatives; in
    Hungary in 1956, where for the first time since Kronstadt workers'
    councils appeared as the organs of revolutionary struggle against a
    state-capitalist bureaucracy instead of a bourgeoisie; in Algeria in 1963;
    and most recently in Chile (1970–73) in embryonic forms such as the
    *commandos communales* (community proto-councils) and the *cordones
    industriales* (multi-workplace proto-councils), which were, however, still
    largely dominated by various bureaucracies.

[^17]: The root definition of “resonance” coming from physics, from the
    mechanics of oscillators, is revealing here. For example:

    > “(a) an abnormally large response of a system having a natural
    > frequency, to a periodic external stimulus of the same, or nearly the
    > same, frequency. (b) the increase in intensity of sound by sympathetic
    > vibration of other bodies.”
    >
    > — C.L. Barnhart & Jess Stein, *The American College Dictionary*, Random
    > House, (New York, 1964), p. 1033, “resonance, n.”.

    That is, *mechanical* resonance occurs when the natural frequency of
    oscillation — the ‘immanent’, ‘essential’, or *internal* frequency — of
    the resonating object is identical to the frequency of externally “forced”
    oscillation, i.e., to the *external* frequency. Social resonance occurs as
    *inter-recognition*; when social individuals recognize *themselves in each
    other*, the other in themselves, and themselves in the world they produce;
    when they recognize their *concrete universality*. It occurs when what
    “society” needs of them is also what they need of themselves: their own
    *production*; their own *development*; their own *self-realization*; when
    what “society” needs of them is not imposed as an *external*, alien force,
    coercively by the state or unconsciously, as the “law of value,” by
    capital, but as their own, internally generated self-force, welling-up
    spontaneously within them. From each according to his desire, to each
    according to his desire. This is possible *sustainedly* only once the
    necessary social conditions for such a recognition and such a need have
    been produced historically, i.e., only once certain relations of humanity
    to itself, — namely, *inter-production* — grasped early in an alienated
    form as the “eternal truths” of religions, have *become fact*, that is,
    become *historically materialized*.

[^18]: This is Marx's early term for what he later calls the “social relations
    of production”. See: Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, *The German
    Ideology*, Progress Publishers, (Moscow. 1968), pp. 89, 92, etc.

[^19]: We realize that this expanded concept of exchange maybe difficult to
    accept for a reader whose objective life has been dominated by
    exchange-*value* relationships. However, the critique of exchange-*value*
    is not to be confused with an abstract or moralistic negation of exchange
    itself *as such*. The concept of exchange is much “bigger” than the
    concept of exchange-value — or *quid pro quo* — exchange: of commodity
    exchange-relations. Exchange-value exchange is a *transitory*, an
    historical, *disappearing necessity*. Exchange as such, however, is a
    necessity of society in general, of social existence as such, both with
    regard to society's relations to nature and with regard to its
    self-relations, the social relations proper:

    > “The labour-process […] is human action with a view to the production of
    > use-values, appropriation of natural substances to human requirements;
    > it is the necessary condition for effecting exchange of matter between
    > man and Nature; it is the everlasting nature-imposed condition of human
    > existence, and therefore is independent of every social phase of that
    > existence, or rather, in common to every such phase.”

    > Human Production”, in Easton and Guddat, Writings of the Young Marx On
    > Philosophy and Society, Doubleday and Company, (Garden City, 1967), p.
    > 277.

    Exchange-*value* is historically specific to a certain phase of the
    development of the social productive forces (of the social individual):
    *exchange* in general is historically general, independent of any given
    form or stage of *human* society. *Exchange* characterizes in fact not
    only the labour-process generally, but every aspect of human activity;
    intercourse with other human beings and with nature. In fact, all
    interaction, social and natural, and all life-processes in general —
    conversation, dining, sexual intercourse, and even “passive”
    *contemplation of*nature — fall within this expanded concept of exchange —
    are at the very least, “exchange-of-*action*”. Even in one-sided
    gift-giving; even when someone gives you an object and you give no object
    in direct return — let alone an exchange-value *equivalent* in return — an
    exchange has taken place, though not an exchange-value (commodity)
    exchange; not an exchange of the sort which reproduces the law of value.
    (In capitalist society there also exist various underdeveloped forms or
    approximations of exchange-value relationships, e.g. bartering — even the
    bartering of “favors”. In fact, *quid pro quo* — literally “this for that”
    — is, in a society based on privatized survival, a standard and a paradigm
    which pervades not only “economic” relationships as such, but comes to
    dominate all aspects of social life — including the most “intimate”
    personal relationships).

    Communist society is inconceivable *with* any but the most minimal,
    marginal survivals of *exchange-value* exchange, but it is likewise
    inconceivable *without* exchange; exchange in objects, information,
    energy, experience, etc. between man and man and between man and nature —
    without what Marx calls “social metabolism”.

[^21]: The passage may appear to be confusing here and throughout, perhaps in
    part because the translators did not comprehend the dialectical concepts
    being used nor the full radicality of what was being asserted, which, to
    the Kantian or “Flatland” mind is impossible or absurd. For instance,
    “social being” = “the being of society”; “the *existence* of society”;
    “social existence” — and not just “a” social being. Marx is asserting here
    that the social individual is the *essence* of society: the substance and
    “*nature*” of society — the place where the character of society, the
    social character, becomes visible, manifest.

[^28]: Revolutionary theory and revolutionary ideology are not only different,

    ‘Revolutionary ideology’ names the *representation* of this revolutionary
    theory by state-capitalist bureaucracy; the transformation of
    revolutionary theory into a *spectacle* through which the last stand of
    capital, as state-capital, momentarily strengthens its position by
    masquerading as the very *negation* of capital, i.e. as communist society.

    (appropriately) “Fear Neither Hardship Nor Death in Serving the People”
    (Foreign Languages Press, Peking, 1970), which pamphlet discusses “the

[^32]: The term “anti-state” was employed by the Situationists to designate

    “state”.

    A well-known authority on Marx' views described the anti-state character
    of the Paris Commune thusly:

[^33]: See footnote 15. Even as early as the Paris Commune of 1871, at a time
    and place where the *objective* socialization of the means of production
    had not proceeded very far (in terms of large factories, etc.), this theory
    of *associated production* had begun to become consciously *revolutionary*
    practice. The document quoted below, a mandate from two labour unions for
    their delegates to the Commune's Commission on Labour Organization,
    proposes a form of what would appear to be council-capitalism, and employs
    the term “associate” to designate the producers after they have ceased to
    be proletarians:

    > “At its meeting of April 23rd, 1871, in keeping with the Commune's
    > decree of April 16th, the Mechanics Union and the Association of Metal

[^34]: “Generalized self-management” is a term which has been used by
    Situationists to describe the *mode of production* of communist society.
    It refers to the process whereby we take directly into our own hands every
    aspect of social life. This must mean the determinate negation of Capital,
    commodity production, and of all separate powers, i.e., of all powers
    other than that of the associated producers themselves. Embryonic forms of
    self-management have appeared repeatedly through modern history. Its very
    possibility was first demonstrated in the Paris Commune of 1871, and
    throughout the twentieth century in the movements of the *workers'
    councils*. Workers' councils have arisen repeatedly, usually in critical
    situations where the ineptitude of the present owners of society had been
    clearly and practically demonstrated. On such occasions (Russia 1905,
    Kronstadt 1921, Spain 1936–37, etc.) proletarians have recognized that
    they've been running everything all along, and that now it was only a
    matter of running everything *for themselves*. If generalized
    self-management means “a society in which the full and free development of
    every individual forms the ruling principle,”[^85] it can allow no
    accommodation to any higher authority, fetish, or reified social
    relationship. In the past, Situationists have clearly recognized that the
    importance of self-management is not only its *form*, but also and
    decisively its *content* — clearly “self-management” of the present world
    (i.e. of commodity production, etc.) is of little interest to a radical
    subject. They have been interested only in the self-management of the
    total and qualitative transformation of the world.

    We have since expanded the definition of generalized self-management to
    include more sides of its manifold dialectic. As we now use it, it must
    mean not only the management *by* selves of the world (and presumably of a
    world of marvels), but furthermore it must mean the management *of self*.
    What we are talking about is the dialectical unity of subject and object
    whereby our activity — i.e. our sensuous relationship with the objective
    world — becomes the realization, i.e. actualization i.e. the
    *objectification* of our subjectivity — of our *selves*. The making
    *explicit* of all that we are implicitly. This is largely what Marx was
    getting at when he spoke of man's environment as his “inorganic
    body”[^86]. A necessary meaning of Marx “I must *be* everything”[^87]
    (emphasis added) now becomes clear in its many-sidedness. “We want the
    whole world to be our conscious self-creation”[^88], i.e. not only the
    creation *by* but the creation *of* our selves. (This concept is to be
    further expanded in an upcoming article which will probably appear in our
    journal.)

    Clearly therefore, any form of “self-management” which does not decisively
    put an end to all forms of commodity production and, indeed, of labour
    itself, loses altogether this side of the dialectic. In a “self-managed”
    workers enterprise (of e.g. the anarcho-syndicalist or Titoist model), the
    workers *at best* manage their non-selves, i.e., the process and the
    congelation of their own alien activity (*non-self*-management).
    “Generalized self-management” in its fullest sense must be the breakdown
    not only of all separate power, but of separation per se (legal,
    political, social, *personal*, etc.). *We must be everything!* Thus, “the
    proletarians, if they are to assert themselves as individuals, will have
    to abolish the very condition of their existence hitherto (which has,
    moreover, been that of all society up to the present), namely, labour.
    Thus they find themselves directly opposed to the form in which, hitherto,
    the individuals, of which society consists, have given themselves
    collective expression, that is, the State. In order, therefore, to assert
    themselves as individuals, they must overthrow the State.”[^89]

    What is generalized self-management, “if not the absolute elaboration of
    [man's] creative dispositions, without any preconditions other than the
    antecedent historical evolution which makes the totality of this
    evolution, i.e. the evolution of all human powers as such, unmeasured by
    any *previously established* yardstick — an end in itself? What is this,
    if not a situation where man does not reproduce himself in any determined
    form, but produces his totality? Where he does not seek to remain
    something formed by the past, but is in the absolute movement of
    becoming?”[^90] What if not all the world as the realization of our
    passions?

[^36]: It is important above all here to note that this “dictatorship of the
    proletariat” can be nothing other than the international power of the
    workers' councils itself. It is a *dictatorship* of the still-proletarian
    class over the remnants of the bourgeoisie and the bureaucracy, because it
    acts *coercively* against their efforts to re-expropriate social power
    and, whenever it (that is, the general assemblies of the workers) deems
    necessary, by force of arms. But it is an *anti-state dictatorship*,
    especially with regard to the suppression of the state-capitalist
    bureaucracy, with respect to which, the suppression of the state and the
    suppression of the class are one in the same (it goes without saying that
    the “suppression” of a class as a class, its destruction as *such*, does
    *not* necessarily entail the “destruction” or “liquidation” of the
    individuals who composed it; it is the class determination which is to be
    determinately negated here, not biological individuals, and social
    relations can not be negated without “negating” individuals). On the
    concept of the “anti-state”, see footnote 32.

    In a letter to August Bebel (March 18–28, 1875) Engels (as a delegation of
    himself and Marx) gave a critique of the draft programme of the United
    Social-Democratic Workers' Party of Germany. His severe criticism,
    particularly of its muddledly statist aspects, is of much significance not
    only for this particular programme, but furthermore it sheds much light
    toward a correct interpretation of virtually all of his and Marx's works:

    > “The whole talk about the state should be dropped, especially since the
    > Commune [the Paris Commune of 1871], which was no longer a state in the
    > proper sense of the word. The ‘people's state’ has been thrown in our
    > faces by the Anarchists to the point of disgust, although already Marx's
    > book against Proudhon [The Poverty of Philosophy] and later the
    > Communist Manifesto directly declare that with the introduction of the
    > socialist order of society the state will dissolve of itself and
    > disappear. As, therefore, the state is only a transitional institution
    > which is used in the struggle, in the revolution, to hold down one's
    > adversaries by force, it is pure nonsense to talk of a free people's
    > state: so long as the proletariat still uses the state, it does not use
    > it in the interests of freedom but in order to hold down its
    > adversaries, and as soon as it becomes possible to speak of freedom the
    > state as such ceases to exist. We would therefore propose to replace
    > state everywhere by Gemeinwesen, a good old German word which can very
    > well convey the meaning of the French word ‘commune!’”

    This critique is perhaps one of the most important statements ever made by
    Engels or Marx.

    introduction by Frederick Engels.)

[^44]: Not that we prefer the psychedelic cretins and nouveau-Babbits of hip
    capitalism (Berkeley has provided an interesting development of these
    respective forms. Here their abstract unity has digressed into a
    disgusting symbiosis between the “winner” and “loser” forms of the hip
    movement's remnants. Thus we have the rise of the merchants of
    counter-culture, who's “success” largely feeds off the continuing
    degeneracy of the post-psychedelic *lumpens*).

[^45]: Here even the old “human nature” argument — in all cases the last
    recourse of bourgeois ideology — is turned against itself and the
    miserable cretins who would propagate it.

[^46]: See footnote 29.

[^47]: This relationship might be clarified in terms of a dialectical symbolic
    logic, with $p$, ${\neg}p$, and ${\neg}{\neg}p$ symbolizing *states* —
    *states of affairs*, states of some system, “*states of the world*” — or
    symbolizing *sentences* which represent “*statements*”; formulae about or
    *formulations of* these states of affairs. The negation sign ${\neg}$ here
    symbolizes some *transformation*, some *determinate* negation, of the
    sentential letters, such as $p$, to which it is applied as a prefix (the
    exact content of this operator thus has to be specified in each case).
    Thus, ${\neg}{\neg}p$ is related, by negation to ${\neg}p$ and to $p$. The
    slashed equals-sign, $\neg$, is here employed as the symbol for the
    relation of dialectical *contradiction*.

    With $p$ representing that (social) state of affairs characterized as
    “narrow egoism”, ${\neg}p$ representing the state of “altruism”, and
    ${\neg}{\neg}p$ “communist egoism”, we can formulate this relation as
    follows:

    > $({\neg}{\neg}p \neq p) \wedge ({\neg}{\neg}p \neq {\neg}p) \wedge (p \neq {\neg}p)$

    or simply:

    > $(p \neq {\neg}{\neg}p \neq {\neg}p)$

    The latter two conjunctions would be granted truth even by formal logic,
    but the first belongs exclusively to dialectical logic. Only a vestige, a
    shadow of the first conjunct holds within formal logic:

    “A sentence and its negation are called *contradictories* of one another.
    Though any sentence of the form ${\neg}o$ has two equivalent
    contradictories, $o$ and ${\neg}{\neg}o$, it has become customary to speak
    loosely of ‘the’ contradictory of a sentence.”

    > — Benson Mates, Elementary Logic, Oxford University Press, (New York,
    > 1972). Second Edition, p. 119n.

    The above quotation holds for dialectical logic as well, except that in
    the case of dialectical logic, $o$ and ${\neg}{\neg}o$ would not be
    equivalent, but rather would be *also contradictories*. We might clarify
    this by modeling dialectical logic as involving not merely two
    truth-*values*, but rather (at least) three *related* truth-*states*
    (really, an *indefinite number of negation-related* truth-states — see
    dotted trajectory in *Figure 1*). We might depict the relations among the
    sentence-symbols $p$, ${\neg}p$. and ${\neg}{\neg}p$ in terms of a
    truth-state-space, as follows, the different states being connected —
    linked semantically and/or temporally — as *extreme points* or “moments”
    along a state-space *trajectory*:

    ![*Figure 1*: Truth-Space for Dialectical Logic](images/rtbg/1.jpg)

    $p$ is *an* opposite of ${\neg}{\neg}p$ because, *relative* to $p$,
    ${\neg}{\neg}p$ has an extreme value of the trajectory coordinates in a
    component direction *away* from $p$ (in this case the $+y$ direction).
    This criterion of *relative* *extremity* gives an *immanent* *standard* of
    “oppositeness”, i.e., the point $p'$ is more opposite of ${\neg}{\neg}p$
    than $p$ is, but it does not occur immanently, that is, on the trajectory,
    and so is not a criterion; ${\neg}p$ is an opposite (or contradictory) of
    ${\neg}{\neg}p$ (in the $+x$ direction), as well as of $p$ (also in the
    $+x$ direction), and vice-versa, and so on. Thus, $p$, ${\neg}p$, and
    ${\neg}{\neg}p$ correspond, in an approximate way, to aspects of,
    respectively, the “thesis”, “antithesis”, and “synthesis” of vulgar
    dialectics.

    So under these definitions the formulae (1) hold for the depiction of
    *Figure 1*, and for them it represents a valid “model” or
    “interpretation”.

    We can arrive at a formal-logical version of this model by *reduction*,
    specifically, reduction by one dimension (the y dimension) — yielding a
    kind of “top view” of *Figure 1*:

    ![*Figure 2:* Truth-Space for Formal Logic
    (“Flatland”)](images/rtbg/2.jpg)

    The great advantage of the Dialectical Logic (Figure 1) is seen concretely
    by using the interpretation:

    > $p$: (the) “narrow egoism” (theory) is true of the world.  
    > ${\neg}p$: “altruism” is true of the world.  
    > ${\neg}{\neg}p$: “communist egoism” is true of the world.

    The model posits $p \rightarrow {\neg}p \rightarrow {\neg}{\neg}p$ as the
    course of an *evolution* relating (“connecting”) the three states. It
    could be interpreted as depicting, for example, the evolution of the
    social individual from a state of narrow egoism to one of altruism to
    expanded egoism, or the evolution of a society from a state characterized
    as (by) “narrow egoism” *and* “altruism” to one characterized as
    “communist egoism”.

    Here indeed $p$ and ${\neg}{\neg}p$, “stacked” one on top of the other,
    appear to coincide, hence, are “equivalent”. The dimension in which the
    separation of $p$ from ${\neg}{\neg}p$ occurs is here invisible. The
    trajectory from $p$ to ${\neg}p$ to ${\neg}{\neg}p$ or $p$ again is here
    merely a *vicious* *circle*, getting nowhere new. It merely bespeaks an
    endless, ineluctable Kantian *oscillation* within the “antimony” of narrow
    egoism ($p$) versus altruism (${\neg}p$).

    The $y$ dimension might be posited here as the temporal, historical
    dimension — as either the coordinate for *historical time* itself or for
    some *time-like* state-variable (= a state-variable whose magnitude grows
    *monotonically* with time). With the *elimination* of this dimension
    (*abstraction* from time, from history, from concrete *duration*), the
    depiction succeeds as a model of the formal logic of these sentences ($p$,
    ${\neg}p$, ${\neg}{\neg}p$) and their inter-mutual relations.

[^49]: *Objectification* names the specific quality of *human* production in
    general.

    Objectification is the *making objective*, the making into an external,
    immediately observable, sensuously manifest object, of something that was
    subjective, invisible, internal to the subject producing the
    objectification. Through his activity, even if this activity is only an
    instantly perishable *gesture*, the subject inscribes himself in the
    objective world, makes the part of it upon which he labours into a
    *reflection* of himself; *materializes* his thought, his intentions, his
    needs, his desires, his *imaginations*. This is the externalization of the
    internal: exteriorization; extension. This is the *self-objectification of
    the subject*.

[^51]: That is to say, they cannot be bought off within the narrow realm of
    corruptions I normally offered. We are the last to deny that “every man
    has his price.” But just as Hegel demonstrated that mere quantitative
    differences can, past a certain point, actually become qualitative
    changes, so the radical subject escalates his price so high that it
    finally transcends altogether the realm of exchange-value, and for that
    matter, of all partial appropriations.

[^52]: We use the term “secular Chritianism” to refer to all those
    non-theological (“secularized”) ideologies which grew up out of the long
    historical decomposition of Christianity, forming its secular
    continuation, up to and including the Church of Lenin, and which all of
    them feature self-sacrificial and moral-fetishist syndromes, coupled with
    an interpretation of human behavior in terms of a concept of sin (no
    matter what this concept happens to be *named* in a particular ideological
    variant, or whether it is recognized as such and named in that particular
    variant *at all*).

    In fact, a part of the initial impetus which led to the formulation of
    *this* theory (the theory of communist egoism) arose from the personal
    contact of several of our founding members with the malpractice of one of
    the early pro-Situationist groups in Berkeley, named (appropriately)
    “Contradiction”, who busied themselves precisely with going around
    condemning, “excluding” (excommunicating), and “breaking with” everyone in
    sight in retribution for *sins* against various Situationist anti-morals;
    sins such as “being bourgeois”, “participating in spectacular life”, etc.
    The general name for the “sin” concept central to this particular brand of
    secular Christian ideology was “separation” — having “separation” in one's
    daily life was the general form of reprobate behavior. That such
    “separations” might be a source of conscious misery of which an individual
    might gladly rid himself or herself at the earliest possible opportunity,
    without need of moralistic coercion, seemed never to occur to these
    Pontiffs, evidently because of their singularly ungreedy investment in
    sado-masochistic transactions.[^91]

[^53]: Karl Marx, *Grundrisse: Foundations of the Critique of Political
    Economy (Rough Draft)*, translated by Martin Nicolaus, Penguin, (London,
    1973), passim.

[^54]: It should be *no* secret by *now* that the secret of the economic
    anchorage of the concept of alienation in Marx is in none other than the
    exact, juridical-economic meaning of that term: to “alienate” is to sell;
    “alienation” is “transfer of property”; the very *activity* of *commodity*
    — or “quid pro quo” — *exchange* itself. Thus the theoretical
    comprehension of the alienation of man in capitalist society is grounded
    in the self-alienation of the worker; the fact that the proletarian must
    sell himself to capital for a wage, and thereby forfeit all control over
    his productive, creative life, and over the objective world which he
    produces in the exercise of that life — the fact of the proletarian's
    *self*-dispossession.

    The fact of his dispossession of the *means of (re)production* of his life
    under capitalism is thus only a corollary of his non-ownership of
    *himself* in production. Bourgeois political economy is the science of
    selling; of the social activity of exchange-value exchange and production.
    It is first of all in this *sense* that bourgeois political economy (and,
    for that matter, bureaucratic “Marxist” “political economy”) is “the
    science of *alienation*.”

[^55]: This does not at all mean, for Marx, that productive activity cannot
    become pleasurable, attractive, self-realizing activity. It only means
    that work cannot become “play” in the sense of frivolous play in class
    societies, where the subject's survival is not immediately at stake in his
    activity, i.e. where his survival is guaranteed by the productive activity
    of others and where his activity is confined to a sequestered zone and
    specialized social category “play” which is not allowed to overspill into
    “serious” social production proper. “Work” activity thus has an aspect of
    conscious necessity, danger, which *frivolous* “play” activity lacks. This
    indicates how the resolution of the present contradiction between “work”
    and “leisure”, or “production” and “consumption”, cannot take the form of
    one-sidedly embracing the antithesis of work, “play”, but only of the
    unitary negation of *both* — that is, the negation of their
    *contradiction* itself; their *synthesis*: free creative activity, or
    “free human production”. There is another passage in *The Grundrisse*
    wherein Marx seems to pass over the same region of his conceptual
    manifold, with slightly more amplitude on this aspect of the question:

    > “It seems to be far from [Adam] Smith's thoughts that the individual “in
    > his normal state of health, strength, activity, skill and efficiency”,
    > might also require a normal portion of work, and of rest from rest. It
    > is true that the quantity of labour to be produced seems to be
    > conditioned by external circumstances, by the purpose to be achieved,
    > and the obstacles to its achievement that have to be overcome by labour.
    > But neither does it occur to A. Smith that the overcoming of such
    > obstacles may itself constitute an exercise in liberty, and that these
    > external purposes lose their character of mere natural necessities and
    > are established as purposes which the individual himself fixes. The
    > result is the selfrealization and objectification of the subject,
    > therefore real freedom, whose activity is precisely labour. Of course he
    > is correct in saying that labour has always seemed to be repulsive, and
    > forced upon the worker from the outside, in its historical form of
    > slave-labour, bond-labour, and wage-labour, and that in this sense
    > non-labour could be opposed to it as liberty and happiness.
    >
    > This is doubly true of this contradictory labour which has not yet
    > created the subjective and objective conditions (which is lost when it
    > abandoned pastoral conditions) which make it into attractive labour and
    > individual self-realization. This does not mean that labour can be made
    > merely a joke, as Fourier naively expressed it in shop-girl terms.
    > Really free labour, the composing of music for example, is at the same
    > time damned serious and demands the greatest effort. The labour
    > concerned with material production can only have this character if (1)
    > it is of a social nature, (2) it has a scientific character and at the
    > same time is universal labour, i.e. if it ceases to be human effort as a
    > definite, trained natural force, gives up its purely natural, primitive
    > aspects and becomes an activity of a subject controlling all the forces
    > of nature in the production process. Moreover, A. Smith is thinking only
    > of the slaves of capital. For example, even the semi-artistic workers of
    > the Middle Ages cannot be included in his definition.”

    modes of human productive activity as the abolition of labour' —

    “pleasure” and “enjoyment”, as “consumption.” He has indeed produced, as
    best as can be, the state-capitalist translation of the *Grundrisse*, as
    is evidenced also in his rendering of *ager publicus* (‘common land’, cf.

[^62]: This is “objectify” not used in the sense of the subject who inscribes
    himself in the objective world through his activity; expresses his
    subjectivity in objects and objective states-of-the-world he creates, but
    in the sense of the subject who is treated like a thing; turned into a
    pseudo-object. These two senses are thus almost exactly opposite.
    Throughout, we indicate this second usage by enclosing the word in double
    quotes, to distinguish it from the unquoted usage.

[^63]: This is a bit of systems-theory state-space terminology. “Attractors”
    are the “ruts,” the “vicious circles” where evolution gets hung-up and
    tarries; where evolutionary trajectories are “captured”, sometimes for
    long periods. All of the major historical social-relations (“modes of
    production”; “forms of intercourse”, or “means of production” as Marx
    sometimes calls them in *The Grundrisse*) — the primitive communal, the
    “asiatic”, the slavery-based, the feudal, the capitalist, etc., can be
    seen as “attractors” in social evolution, with the “asiatic” mode of
    production (“Oriental despotism”) representing, as a highly
    history-resistant form, a particularly strong “capture”. See Hans J.
    Bremerman, ‘On the Dynamics and Trajectories of Evolutionary Processes’ in
    *Biogenesis And Homeostasis*, Springer-Verlaag, 1971).

[^64]: *Reification* names the inversion of abstract and concrete — the
    treating of abstractions as if they were exterior things, and more
    specifically, the inversion of subject and object — the treating of
    objects or abstractions as if they were subjects; of subjects as if they
    were objects or abstractions.

[^65]: Here again the sense of *objectified* differs from our normal usage,
    which is the reason we put quotes around it. See footnote 62.

[^66]: The community of “sisters” is the society of radical subjectivity, the
    concrete unity of selves, the resonance of egoisms — *turned on its head*!
    Here lies the supreme reification. The would-be concrete particular is not
    a concrete particular (i.e. a subject, self-determinately objectified) at
    all, but rather only a particular case of the abstract universal (in this
    case, “sister”)… nothing other than *an abstraction of an abstraction* —
    concrete inversion, reification, being-for-another; a *materialized
    self-spectacle*. This reification is epitomized in ideological moralisms
    of “liberation” in “sisterhood”, such as when the spontaneous, subjective
    negativity by an individual ego is met with the aphoristic moralism that
    “Sisters don't treat each other that way!”

[^67]: “Subjectification” is here the contrary of “objectification” (see
    footnote ); it means *not* the “making subjective of the objective”, as in
    the production of knowledge (“internalization of the external”), etc. but
    rather “the making *more* subjective of the *pseudo-objective*; of a
    subject who has been reduced to a pseudo-object — the return of
    subjectivity to the real subjects, previously *de-subjectified*.”

[^68]: Obviously, this necessarily includes the *self-objectification* of this
    new inter-subjectivity.

[^71]: While we criticize the use of the term ‘principle’ when this usage is a
    symptom of projection (self-disowning), as in phrases like “Let's live up

    escapes this critique. That is the usage where ‘principle’ serves as a
    synonym of “invariant”, “law”, “secret”, “key”, etc., as in “The principle
    of this machine is…” or “The principle of this natural process is…”, or
    “The principle of this social relation is…”, etc.

    increasingly desperate forces of classical private capitalism, themselves
    turning state-capitalist, zero-in on it from the other in the context of
    the present, and rapidly deepening, general social crisis. N.C.L.C. is
    about the only relatively live, dynamic tendency on the Left in the U.S.,
    the only one which is in any sense *contemporary* with the present
    historical moment, and, despite its increasingly paranoid hysteria, is
    still lucid enough to be the only Leninist organization on the scene even
    *potentially* capable of bringing the Stalinist variety
    (pure-bureaucratic/bourgeois ruling-class; hybrid, state/private capital)
    of state-capitalist totalitarianism to power in the U.S. The organization
    has had a meteoric rise, and continues to grow rapidly.

    In two recent articles on the “psychology” of working-class organizing
    practice, articles which contain many brilliant developments — secretly
    borrowing much from Reich — which we must greedily appropriate, Lyn
    Marcus, the Fuhrer of N.C.L.C., reaches an almost *Maoist* (cf. footnote
    37) pitch of psycho-pathology in his tyrantings on the subject of
    greed, self-interest, selfishness, etc.:

    > “The will of the worker must become the will to do that which is in the
    > historic interest of the world's working class as a whole, nothing else.
    > If the workers passionately cling to any contrary sentiment of imagined
    > self-interest that sentiment must be seized upon and ripped out of them.
    > No human being has the right to believe or “feel” anything except that
    > which impels him to act in the historic interest of the world's working
    > class as a whole.”

    as well stop right here.

    situations and of the construction of situations developed by the
    Situationist International, but in the sense of the “Transactional
    Analysis” ideology of psychotherapy.
